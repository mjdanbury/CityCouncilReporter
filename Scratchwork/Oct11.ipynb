       "[Document(page_content=\"yeah I should read this more closely before I get up here right all in favor okay um okay thank you Lincoln that is why in 2009 along with my colleagues and the and the council I passed local La 31 requiring the mayor's office of long-term planning and sustainability now known the mayor's office of climate environmental justice to draft a comprehensive Wetlands protection strategy for the city the overall the overall goals of which were to conserve protect enhance restore and expand the city's wetlands and to standardize its approach to Wetlands management this law this Law requires a drafting and publication of a report to be submitted to the commissioner of D and the commissioner of parks and recreation no later than you know July 15 209 with an update published no later than July 15th every second year thereafter since then meaning since the bill was since the law was passed only one report has been published in relation to this law in 2012 in 2016 and 2021 the natural areas conserv in conjunction with the parks department released the wetlands management framework for New York City but is unclear if those documents are meant to satisfy the requirements of local La 31 this reporting requirement created by local law is not a suggestion it is the law again this is not this Administration this is another Administration so you know uh the the the this Administration must do what due diligence in publishing and submitting the required report in a timely manner and not when and not whenever it deems convenient but that's not this Administration I would like to thank the great committee staff whove done such great work over the years committee councils samaris Swanson and CLA McLaughlin policy analy policy analyst Ricky cha and Andrew borne financial analyst Andrew Lane Lawless finally my legislative director Navi core for all of their hard work let me recognize a member MERS of the Environmental Protection resiliency and waterfronts committee who are here have council member Holden council member wrestler council member men council member nurse council member Hanks is joining us on Zoom before I turn it over to my uh co-chair just a you know a little bit of housekeeping um uh there's this uh you know phenomenon that's been creeping up in some Council hearings lately where Witnesses ask questions of the panel we don't answer questions so we're here to hear from you we ask you questions so any questions directed us would be ruled out of order by me and we also want the uh testimony we have a lot of witnesses to be on topic uh you know we understand that people are passionate about funding for Parks uh this is not a budget hearing um you know we this Council stands squarely in favor of uh you know tree canopy development that's why in the last stated meeting a couple of days ago we passed the uh you know botcher Bill to require the 30% of canopy um of course the challenge is to figure out how to pay for that and a lot of people are here to talk about that this is not a budget hearing so it's just like we get that the 30% number is really important you know we'll let folks make their point but um generally speaking we want to stay on topic we have the we have the we have the oversight topic we've got the we got the bill and we got the reso and we want Focus testimony on those so um so I was just a bad guy Shaker so you don't have to say any of that stuff okay and with that it is my great privilege to um recognize my esteem co-chair uh uh chair shik Krishna chair of the parks committee I recognize chair Krishnan thank you so much chair Jano uh it's an honor to co-chair this hearing with you and good afternoon everyone I am council member Shaker Krishnan chair of the committee on Parks and Recreation and I'd like to thank my fellow co-chair Council Morano for agreeing to hold this joint hearing today uh which unfortunately um comes with very good timing given the recent events um in New York City on uh just a couple weeks ago when it comes to our climate the climate crisis is here we all know that all too well and painfully so and its effects threaten the well-being of all New Yorkers one of the more immediate effects which has been particularly damaging to the city this year as we know is flooding these flooding events most recently including tropical storm ofilia were rain events that laid bare the inadequacy of the city's infrastructure to handle massive rainfall once again large areas of the city that had never seen significant flooding before were shockingly underwater and once again this past summer where a multitude of severe weather events have occurred throughout the world this has set a new unfortunate milestone for being the hottest summer on record over and over again the storms the flooding the events that are considered once in a hundred years are happening once every year every couple years and it's a signal of how urgent the climate crisis is right here in our city we are a city surrounded by water and so the necessity for New York to be ever prepared for these increasingly harsh storms is growing more and more important despite these climate change events however there is still time though the clock is ticking to prepare and adapt our infrastructure structure to better handle what will continue to come our way in the future our focus at today's joint hearing will be on how the city's parks and wetlands can best be adapted to mitigate the effects of climate change such as flooding and extreme heat there is still time to prepare and adapt our infrastructure to better handle what will continue to come our way in the future particularly by increasing the use of green infrastructure and making making our Parks more resilient the city's Green Space can be adapted to expand the resiliency features such as through the use of expanding the green streets program building more rain Gardens in areas that are starved of Green Space broadening the reach of Park features to their surrounding neighborhoods building more parks and playgrounds with bio swes green features and permeable surfacing converting unused or abandoned land into Green Space and of course maintaining and expanding the city's tree stock there are important pieces of legislation that we've passed in this Council to address these issues and expand Green Space where none has existed before on top of that just last week our city council and the week before passed historic legislation to invest in and expand our tree canopy and of course we've also looked at ways to increase and improve water safety in our city too which is just as much a part of the climate crisis as as every other emergency that we face all of those things are crucial but I also want to call attention to the fact that we will not be able to make our city environmentally resilient until we invest in our Park system the way it should be and we will not have a park system that reflects in resources the value it holds for all of us from a climate standpoint to our health and wellbe being we will not have a park system with the resources that reflect that value until we achieve at least 1% of our city budget for Parks something that we need to do not only because it is crucial for our city it is crucial for climate change but it is also our city catching up with every other major city in the United States our parks are essential to our health and well-being the parks department has been heavily part of this process specifically to address climate change specifically when they developed resiliency guidelines in November 2017 entitled design and planning for flood resiliency guidelines for NYC parks which is part of the broader plan NYC framework the guidelines serve as a manual for planners designers and communities to reference while planning and developing coastally resilient parks and Waterfront spaces in particular the guidelines discuss certain Beach and Boardwalk best practices including the development of a plan for necessary Beach nourishment to ensure the best possible performance during and after a storm elevating boardwalks to be higher than the 100-year flood plane and the usage of concrete planks set on top of concrete and steel piles to create stronger and more resilient boardwalks I'm curious to see how this has informed the process by which the parks department has developed and renovated its various properties to become more resilient and whether recent storms have altered in any way how the department thinks about its resiliency planning I'd like to ensure this joint hearing explores and clarifies some points relating to parks and resiliency as well including how Federal funding from the infrastructure and jobs Act and the inflation reduction act are being allocated to enhance Parks resiliency work this Federal funding plays a crucial role in supporting our parks and green spaces I'd also like to hear more about the role that Parks will play in the climate strong Community project and the progress that has been made in implementing practices from the wetlands management framework and also how Parks will adapt to as I mentioned before the unacceptable budget cuts that mayor Adams has recently proposed in a way that not only cuts from our Parks vital services but also to understand how they will affect any resiliency projects the time to act is now we must urgently work to address this climate crisis and invest in the parts of our infrastructure our Parks our playgrounds our coastlines to fortify and protect our city from the worsening climate crisis we are already behind the ball and so we cannot afford any delay in implementing resiliency projects that are crucial to our being able to withstand the worst effect effects of the climate crisis here too our parks are on the front lines when it comes to this work thank you to everyone who has joined today for members of the administration for your testimony and for members of the public and Advocates who are testifying to and for your participation in this hearing I'd like to recognize our colleagues who are here today as part of this committee council member Holden council member Lee council member Marte council member Menan council member wrestler council member Ang council member Carr and council member Brooks Powers thank you and I'll turn it over to our committee councel to swear in today's witnesses can you please raise your right hand do you swear or affirm to tell the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth today you may begin all right um good afternoon um and thank you chair Jano chair chrishan members of the uh Environmental Protection and Parks and Recreation committees my name is RIT agerwal which I'm Chief climate officer of New York City and uh commissioner of the Department of Environmental Protection uh and I am joined today by Elijah Hutchinson our new executive director of the mayor's office of climate environmental justice and Meritt Larson assistant Commissioner of natural resources and planning at the department of parks thank you for the opportunity to speak today on New York City's climate resilience efforts as chair Christian just said climate change is here um we have all witnessed its impact as recently as two weeks ago with tropical storm ofilia since day one the Adams Administration has been focused on better preparing the city for the impacts of climate change including creating my role uh as part of my role I oversee MJ which leads the city's efforts to ensure New York City is reducing its emissions while also protecting New Yorkers from the intensifying impacts of climate change with a focus on equity and public health MJ Works to make buildings efficient and resilient ensure infrastructure his climate ready transform streets in the public realm into living open spaces and make energy clean and resilient and I'm particularly excited about the addition of director executive director Hutchinson to the office he previously LED Coastal res millions in Greenway initiatives as vice president for waterfronts at the New York City Economic Development Corporation his work and ideas will be Central to this City's climate policy including resilience and I am pleased to have him as my colleague um I will depart from the text here uh because in putting together what we thought was a reasonably comprehensive but still high level summary of all we're doing it came to 5,000 words and rather than read all of it to you I leave it to you to read I will give you a couple of high points and then uh conclude but I do want you to know we're doing a lot um a lot of it is shaped and and chair chrisan you know alluded to this I think relatively few New Yorkers appreciate that in 2020 the National Climate assessment recategorized New York City from a continental weather Zone to the subtropical climate zone right so literally our climate has changed this is not something that's coming down the pike it is in fact already happened and that is not coincidentally why about the same time we started to see a significant change in flooding um but there is a lot that we are doing to play catchup as as I think the chairman as both chairman mentioned um we are working uh on Coastal resilience as part of plan YC uh in addition addition to continuing the work that was undertaken in the last two administrations in the aftermath of hurricane uh Sandy and continuing to work very closely with the US Army Corps of Engineers on the Harbor and tributary study we have actually recognized that it is time to create a permanent home within city government for the multi- deade work that it will take to create Coastal resilience for New York City we decided that D is the correct home for that and so actually I'm I'm pleased to say that very soon we will begin the process of standing up a new Bureau of coastal resilience I think there is likely to be a need and and chair janaro and I have discussed the fact that at some point we we will probably seek out uh your Collective assistance in legislating that um as part of the agency's formal uh role but it is uh something that we are not waiting to get started on um starting last year uh we also at D began to undertake a broad look at what it will require in fact to bring the city's storm Water Management Systems up to handle this new reality that we face um there was some very good work done in the immediate aftermath of hurricane Ida by the deasio administration we have Incorporated virtually everything from that into the plans that we are now working on through planyc and others in fact uh we recently did a a tally and um basic Bally 95% of what was in The New Normal report is either completed or in progress or it has been replaced by something that is in uh plan YC that accomplishes the same goal so there was not something that we walked away from it is an evolutionary process that frankly expands as we get smarter about the task last year uh my agency with with the mayor released two programs um one explicitly about short-term flood response we called it rainfall ready I'm pleased we've worked with with a number of you all uh to use your offices to help do things like distribute flood barriers and make residents aware of their flood risk part of rainfall ready was actually publishing flood maps that show precisely by burrow block and lot level the flood risk that each address in New York City faces um that allowed us for example to Target the, 1600 most flood prone residential address to which we proactively reached out uh to offer them flood barriers and information about flood insurance and things like that um however the reality is that changing infrastructure whether it's green infrastructure on the surface or gray infrastructure underground is both very expensive and very longterm um I'm naturally impatient and my staff knows that I keep asking why is this a multi-year planning process and as I have come to appreciate what goes into it I have come to appreciate just how difficult it is to change something as powerful as water in a place as crowded and complex and expensive to do work in as New York city so one of our sad realities is as I have said many times the climate is changing faster than our infrastructure can keep up and among the things we need to do and I'll come back to this is figure out how we as a city can in fact make our processes faster and more capacious so we can do more things at once even if we can't do all things faster um among the things that we have done and and again there's a lot of detail in the written testimonies we've made in the written testimony we've made significant progress and continueed to on Blue belts we have great Ambitions for the blue belt program well Beyond Staten Island even though it's a Staten Island native of course um we are working on cloudburst and we are in fact ahead of schedule with more cloudburst projects that uh we are working on than we're committed to in The New Normal report at the end of 2021 so we're very pleased by those um as I think many of you know back last year D implemented the unified storm water rule which requires large properties when they are uh constructed upon or or when significant changes happen on a given parcel that they have to begin to manage storm water on site any storm water managed on site prevents it from flowing into over taxed sewers during a heavy rainstorm and therefore that directly prevents flooding in addition in most parts of the city that kind of work also reduces combined sewer overflows which can uh contributes to the Clean Harbor that we all know and care about um we've made significant progress over the last two years with the flood net sensor program which um I was certainly looking at all day day long on on September 29th and I would imagine some of you uh may have been it as well it is far from complete and and among the things we have been doing uh consistently I will not say actually in response to that storm because we were doing it well before that is trying to figure out how we can change that program in its details or augment it so that it can be built out more quickly we are currently in year two of a five-year build um but that is making a lot of uh Headway already and actually I think it was quite useful on September 29th to be able to see what what was going on um as I think uh chair Krishan alluded to um the mayor's office of climate environmental justice has already kicked off the early planning work around climate strong communities which is our neighborhood level effort at engaging with communities to do multi-hazard planning um and we are working on a voluntary buyout program um which is another one of these things like the Bureau of coastal resilience where it takes a while to figure out the institutional issues um it's not just about having the money although buyouts in New York City are going to be breathtakingly expensive but it is also about how you do the institution so that legally we can conduct transactions that are frankly very unlike the transactions that the city's land acquisition policies and practices are designed uh for you you know just think about the question of how you pay fair market value for a property that has been destroyed legally we have to pay only fair market value right so there's a lot of institutional work that we have to put in place right now and MJ in conjunction with several other agencies is leading that planning work and we're optimistic uh about where that will go um one final thing before I move on uh is heat and I think you both uh both Sher janiro and Cher Krishan mentioned the fact that flooding is not our only risk that as part of being a subtropical City we now have a significant Heat program and as I have said on on many occasions we are keenly aware of the fact that despite the terrible losses we suffered during Hurricane Ida and Hurricane Sandy heat over the last decade is still the way climate change has killed most New Yorkers right that we think more than 350 New Yorkers have died as an excess number over previous patterns due to the higher uh heat levels that we've experienced in some during the summer over the last decade um it's one of the reasons that that this Administration has committed to work towards and this is actually going to be extraordinarily difficult to figure out but to work towards a maximum indoor temperature the reality is the vast majority of bedrooms in New York City have air conditioning those who don't live in affordable housing those who don't live in Nicha those who don't live in places where the economics of it are not going to be easy to figure out um but it is something that we are committed to and I will also make the point that we cannot stop thinking about mitigation that we have to make sure that we work to reduce our carbon emissions because the first thing you do when you find yourself in a hole is stop digging and we've got to help make this problem not get any worse than it already is and that's a the reasons that I'm very proud of The Proposal that this Administration has put out for how to implement local law 97 we think it is thoughtful we think it is actually very aggressive we also think it is correctly designed to work with and and take into account the needs of building owners and among the things that I hope we can have help with from members of the city council is uring that as the state Public Service Commission defines the way it will use the next five billion dollar of systems benefit charge money that is going to be raised from the electric bills of New Yorkers and programmed that they use it in a way that directly helps buildings comply with local law 97 which is I think one of the most important opportunities we have and one that I am desperately worried we will let slip away if the state and Con Edison do not choose to work with us in a collaborative way another area where we could use your help and I I know chairman Janeiro you've been tremendously helpful in this respect already and and uh chair Christan you uh alluded to this um is around New York City getting its fair share of federal and state money the reality is we do not we do not get our fair share of federal and state money um because in fact a large portion of the bipartisan infrastructure law funding is put through the state and unfortunately New York state has decided to apply rules to how it disperses that money particularly with respect to D infrastructure that could contribute towards the overall effort for storm water resilience that that categorically excludes municipalities of more than 300,000 people from applying for those Grant funds we think that decision purely an administrative decision it's neither regulation nor it is law is going to cost New York City a billion dollars in federal funding that it would otherwise be eligible for and I know the committee has put forward some questions about the environmental Bond act $4.2 billion uh for environmental uh efforts including for example a qu billion dollar uh dedicated for voluntary buyouts um the state has not put out guidelines for the vast majority of that money yet we do not know whether it will be equitably distributed um but I do know that New York City is roughly 60% of the tax space and so New York City residents will pay 60% of that $4.2 billion and we have to make very clear to Albany that we should be able to get our fair share I will return now to the last two pages of my written testimony but all of the things I've I've covered are in there and and by the way actually I will also say to intro 1069 of course we're very concerned about uh water quality whether it's in the harbor which my agency pays very close attention to or in in other water bodies we have a very extensive testing program across multiple agencies right now that is primarily driven by the state um both Department of Health and the department of uh environmental um conservation and uh we certainly share the Bill's intention to be able to know what is going on in our water and assure New Yorkers that it is safe we would look forward to working with the committee uh to ensure that this bill does not add unnecessary cost without uh creating value or wind up working at Cross purposes to the practices that we have uh already overseen by our state Regulators so we're very happy to work with you on that um I'll conclude with a couple of points here um major physical projects and I'll I'll go back to the written text uh major physical projects take a significant amount of time typically one to three years for planning and design one to two years for procurement and from one to four years of construction to reduce this time would require changes to several processes such as environmental review ulurp when Acquisitions are required and procurement rules D has invested significantly in improving our procurement with great success we have reduced a nearly two-year procurement cycle a year and a half ago down to just one year just one year um further we have improved internal processes to increase our commitment rate for capital projects one one of my big disappointments of fiscal year 22 was that we achieved only a 69% commitment rate for the year which meant that in that fiscal year DP left nearly half a billion dollars in capital on the table unspent through a significant whole of agency effort we are proud to report that for the first time in a decade D achieved our Capital commitment Target in fiscal year 23 reaching 103% of our $2.3 billion Capital plan uh in fact we committed $2.4 billion in new capital projects a year-on-year increase of $800 million in new projects breaking ground for construction or starting into design uh We've also contributed to the capital process reform task force convened by mayor Adams and controller Lander last year the task force released a set of recommendations including using price adjustment allowance to offset volatile commodity commodity markets expanding work allowances to reduce change order approvals and amending procurement laws and regulations also significantly the task force has made recommendations for the city to adopt alternative project delivery mechanisms such as Progressive design build and has proposed that the DDC become an authority we strongly support these recommendations as these efforts will speed up capital projects reduce costs and increase the city's capacity to address emerging needs um and I will just say I think those are some of the things as as we look to do this work we need help in clearing the obstacles to getting work done uh you know projects face the same delays it doesn't matter whether it's a resilience project a water main project whatever it is you all face the same sort of delays anything we can do to speed up our ability to deliver capital projects is going to make the city more resilient and anything we do that slows that down is going to hinder our ability to achieve resilience um there aren't a lot of easy ways to speed up an individual project but we also face constraints on how many we can take on at once this is basically a function of D's planning and Engineering capacity and ddc's engineering and Contracting capacity I would welcome any help the city council can offer in figuring out how to increase DS and D ddc's capacity to deliver projects or how the city's design procurement and construction timetables can be speeded up climate is generational and because of that there are tradeoffs for example we must balance water rate affordability with our resilience considerations storm water projects are breathtakingly expensive starting last year DP has been working on a set of example projects to understand by extrapolation what it would take to create true storm water resilience across the city we expect to have a bit to say on that later this year and much more to say on that next spring in 2021 my predecessor estimated it would require a cost of $100 billion which would require water rates to go up by about 500% 500% increase in water rates to pay for something like that depending on the level of storm water resilience we want we may have to brace for dramatic increases in water bills and this is not theoretical as we at D Begin work towards our fiscal year 25 Capital plan it would be helpful to know what council members think about how much to invest given that all of our investments in storm water resilience are passed along in the water bill unless we can get state or federal money we must also consider the importance of affordable housing to resilience work three key strategies for resilience requiring air conditioners protecting people who live in basement apartments and the voluntary Mobility Program to remove people who live in atrisk properties are likely to directly reduce the city's affordable housing Supply we cannot have both affordable housing and resilience unless we dramatically increase the creation of new housing across the city and we need to recognize that some homes are impossible to protect from flooding MJ has been collaborating closely with the Department of city planning on city of yes Zoning for Housing Opportunity which was kicked off in September which includes uh dealing with the issues of basement apartments and flood risk and the considerations of climate hazards when ciding and building new housing we have worked closely with our colleagues at the parks department working to explore opportunities for blue belts for storm water resilience and Coastal protection on the large portion of the city's Waterfront that is Parkland but the reality is that there will be times where Parks uses and resilience uses are at odds or at very least cause delay and increase cost right now the protection afforded to Parkland ensures Parks objectives will take precedence but that is a reality that we have to acknowledge I would welcome the council's advice on how to balance these trade-offs some of these are political more than technical so they're very appropriate for elected to aine on all New Yorkers especially those who own their own homes also must take responsibility for protecting themselves in their property as I've have said many times for 400 years New Yorkers have enjoyed a relatively mild climate but this is no longer the case the city can and should and will do as much as it can but tropical rainstorms are difficult to predict and New Yorkers will need to protect themselves anyone who owns a home needs to have flood Insurance homeowners should disconnect their downspouts from their roofs so they do not connect to the sewer line which C often causes sewer backups inside the the home even when the city's sewer is not at capacity and homeowners need to stop and reverse the paving over of permeable surfaces which is increased the proportion of storm water that runs into our sewers uh during the strongest rains I know many of you have worked closely with us to raise awareness through events such as rain barrel giveaways and I very much appreciate those efforts and I would welcome more ways the city council could help us encourage New Yorkers to do their part there is of course a lot more in this uh long testimony um I have a number of colleagues in addition to the two who are here at the table to answer your questions I very much appreciate uh these two committees coming together to tackle uh this really difficult ult but utterly important issue and I look forward to taking your questions thank you thank you commissioner I I think on behalf of all of us we thank you for your comprehensive testimony and for all the reading material that you provided for us um 5,000 words is um a lot and um we appreciate the uh uh you know comprehensive nature of your um testimony uh I'm going to be very brief we have it's always my habit or my practice to um uh we have members here that want to participate in a um significant way so I'll be very brief in order to open the door for all the members with their great ideas um to pose questions um um my committee is now um we've been joining by council member Basquez very happy to uh have her here um I just made some notes as you were going through your statement and I'll just U ask a little bit about that um uh with regard to all that the uh Administration is doing with regard to storm water um I made notes on the front of your we got the rainfall ready Cloud burst technology the blue belts uh um uh unified storm water rule the flood flood net sensor program uh you know we had spoken a while ago you know you and I CU you know I had Vision because way back I don't know 2007 whatever it is um the council did uh you know the first you know comprehensive Stone Water Management plan that was really more for um you know csos then then it was for Street flooding and uh and that accomplished uh you know you we can go on and on about all the good things that that did accomplish and so now we're at um St Water Management 2.0 so to speak where we're really concerned about about Street flooding and um and you know I was going to hold back on my bill because there was so much you know coming out of DP and um Moc EJ that was going to be crystallized uh into um uh into a you know Grand storm water management plan um and you know you made reference to the fact that there'll be something big coming out I imagine that what that is is everything all wrapped up in a bow in terms of this is what we want to do regarding Stone W management going forward and then my plan was then to and that would be a great policy document but then I thought it would be great to uh crystallize that into law which is what we did with stone owners plan does that still seem like a good Paradigm to you um so I think certainly at at some point the idea of of legislating a plan uh may make sense I would ask if you don't mind that we wait until this first piece of work comes out yeah I've been I've been waiting I I will say and I just to manage expectations it is not going to be everything we want all wrapped up in a bow it is the first step towards that uh I'm thinking about it a bit as kind of a an options paper so we can begin collectively as a city to wrap our brains around what this might actually take um because there are a number of big big changes that you could imagine needing and and certainly big projects even if they don't wind up visually being uh challenging yeah I I I I just think it's um I I I I think it's a noble and one that has worked for you and me and for the council in the city going way back to the first planyc when we took some of the good initiatives that and we crystallized them into law and then you know that is I I I I think served the city well so um you know let me just say that you know I and I think on bef of the counil We Stand ready as a partner for you um to do what seems to make sense in terms of what elements of that new plan should be you know reduced to legislation um so that would you know carry forward and I think that uh you know our institution should bear um you know some of the burden of you know doing what we need to do in concert with the administration um to let people know how serious this is and how much it's going to cost and um so you know we have those this is really an offer to burden share is really what it is and so um we certainly appreciate that and um one thing that and again with all of the you know with all of the um uh focus on flooding from all of the storms um of course this is a hearing on resiliency and I know we have the Hat study and all that that's talking about all bunch of different things but what I'm not um what I'm somewhat afraid of having get lost in the all the flooding that we're talking about um is a storm surge and um you know this certainly still you know was is and will be the um you know the you know the most threatening clear and present danger although with the street flooding of late I I think you know I think storm surge has kind of like a run for its money with um everything that we're doing and and all the flooding that we're having and um um and I I I have you know long been a fan of you know storm surge barriers whatever people have different ideas about that but if you could just tell us where we are with regard to um uh you know getting out in front of and planning for storm surge um I I just that has to be part of the equation that has part of the conversation um thank you yes and and certainly and and so uh there's a a couple of things there first of all there are a number of projects sorry if I if I don't site my list I'm going to miss a couple um but there are a number of actually you've got it yeah so I'll ask Elijah to uh to talk to some of the projects that are going on but but quickly we've got a set of projects right now that the city is driving um in conjunction in many cases or or certainly in coordination with the Army Corps but where the city is actually leading the work as it is with easts side Coastal resilience which is certainly underway as as you all know and actually closer to completion then to uh to initiation um part of the reason to create a bureau of coastal resilience is that we accept expect the city's portfolio of projects like that only to grow um and uh we've had some very um promising conversations with the Army Corps about uh uh new models of project delivery that they are empowered to explore that might allow us to do even more of that in conjunction with the Army Corps specifically with respect to the Hat study um the Army Corps has not yet uh released its decision on the you know they they had put out the in the recommended the the recommended alternative which is primarily around landside barriers with uh a number of uh title barriers at uh specific water bodies like Jamaica Bay flushing Bay Kil van Call Etc um I believe they received something like 6,000 comments far more than they had ever done for any project um and I think to their credit the Army Corps has been very communicative with us um and with the the two states that are its Partners um I don't have anything to say on on where that process is heading right now I believe the Army Corps may be here they can they can speak for themselves but I have to say I I think it's going well the sad reality is those are some of the most long-term projects you can imagine right right that is that is the work of decades and not years um which is why again it it become so important for us to think about the things we can do that complement that in the near term but Elijah maybe you could talk about the status some of the specific projects we've got um just adding to also greetings to your first uh uh first appearance for the committee and um we all congratulate you on your new position and wish you well thank you so much it's a it's an honor to be here and as a native New Yorker and someone who's been in government for over a decade uh that's where the fun stops by the way now you're now you're like going to get it we um building off what is saying with our collaboration with the Army Corps they're in a process of um understanding and and responding to all of the feedback they they received from the city but I wanted to focus that our feedback was about making sure that their approach covers multiple hazards and multiple climate risks that they focus on environmental justice communities that they prioritize Community engagement and Outreach as they move forward in their process and that they expedite project delivery as much as possible so that we can see results from their process and work with them to deliver these projects as soon as we can um so there's a ton of collaboration happening with the core as well as with other City agencies on our Coastal resilience portfolio of projects there are some that we're more familiar with like easts side Coastal resilience um there are others that are under construction like the battery Coastal resilience project um Brooklyn Bridge Montgomery Coastal resilience projects which um there are shovels in the ground uh there are also groundbreakings that happened recently at Battery Park City um and then there's other Coastal resilience projects and plans happening in Coney Island and Red Hook and other neighborhoods with where we're raising the shorelines and Street ends to have more protection from those Coastal Storm surges um and then we also have the climate strong communities process which is um the pro the process by which we are developing the a pipeline of of projects uh building off the neighborhoods that were impacted um during Sandy but really thinking about what's next and I know that there were questions about um you know the prioritization of the uh of the projects that are there and what our selection criteria were for for that work um and we are focused on the communities that um are identified as environmental justice communities we're focused on areas that are going to be receiving multiple hazards and multiple climate threats and we're also looking at the areas where it's really going to be possible for a city-led adaptation project to make a difference within that neighborhood um so we're excited to work with you thank you uh thank you very much I have many more questions but um I'm going to be here all day I'm very uh eager to hear from my esteemed uh co-chair and all the members of my committee and uh his committee uh who are here so I'm going to cut off my questioning for now uh um recognize my u u great co-chair um and and uh hear from other members who have a lot of value added but I will just make a note to uh uh staff of my committee that um I would like U uh to um make arrangement for a briefing um with um Elijah to find out you everything that's really going on regarding storm surge that's what kind of keeps me up at night and so um if that's a note to staff if we could get that arranged that would be great okay certainly and with that I uh recog I myam co-chair thank you so you got thank you so much chair Jano uh and thank you for your questions too um before uh I get started with my questions uh I did want to recognize that um from we've been joined by a special guest someone who I met with earlier um mayor nages COA from B nagar Nepal uh who's here we met earlier today in my office uh B mayor KLA is uh the son of the Koda family which was instrumental in bringing democracy to Nepal and uh one of the reasons why he's here for this hearing is because one of his priorities um in be nagar Nepal is to focus on building a wastewater treatment plant uh because in Nepal they're also addressing the serious issue of their streets flooding because of the monsoons so thank you so much mayor COA for joining us it's an honor to have you here and as uh the mayor and I have talked about um and uh uh as we all know the climate crisis is an international crisis um affecting all of our countries in different ways and so I look forward to ways that we can collaborate both here in a city and globally all of us as Citizens to address this issue uh of the climate crisis facing our world um and I just want to make a note to my staff that next time we have a hearing we got to bring somebody too set the bar high on this one we had International here uh but um but well thank you so much to our our panel of uh uh commissioner assistant Commissioners uh who are here today it's uh we appreciate your testimony very much and the work that you're doing in our city when it comes to resilience work um and uh we appreciate also that the testimony commissioner agella is so long because or you had a 5,000-word testimony set to go because of all the work that you all are doing and that's the kind of think we'd like to hear given the magnitude of what we're facing um I just have a few questions myself before turning over to colleagues um I did want to focus assistant commissioner on our parks and how our parks are a critical piece of our uh climate uh resiliency work as well so just you know uh before focusing other areas I did mention in my opening statement the importance of our tree canopy um as part of our uh the fight against climate change too and so one question I had was given the legislation we've passed given the goal that I believe is critical of getting to a 30% tree canopy cover by 2035 um how has Parks approached and thought about um addressing and increasing tree plantings in our tree canopy particularly in areas um that desperately need it um and lack it thank you for the question I um definitely appreciate and Parks greatly appreciates the support and uh emphasis on protecting the city's tree canopy and uh it's obviously a major uh focus of our agency um with respect to uh some of the um questions that we've um received both in advance of the um of the hearing and and in the context of um the in the context of um some of the bills that are proposed uh just wanted to reiterate that our tree planting efforts continue to prioritize areas defined as uh highly heat vulnerable by the department of Health's you know heat vulnerability index and the factors that go into the development of this index so that continues to be the focus area um I'm not going to speak in detail to the our tree planting um priorities and and uh the the testimony that's probably been given to the in the last hearing um that's not my area of expertise and I'm glad to take back any specific questions to um our colleagues um my counterparts in the forestry division in particular uh but U that the roll out of our tree planting efforts both in the RightWay and in our natural areas continues to be you know a main focus um as you um may have heard we've been very successful um not as successful as we wanted to be but pretty successful in getting um uh Federal funding through the IRA for our tree planting efforts uh in particular in natural areas we received you know 10 million dollar through the uh program of urban community forestry just um just announced last month and in addition um we received $5 million uh to focus on Urban Tree can uh Urban Tree Care uh and stewardship and planting in um again in some of our priority environmental justice areas so that uh continues to be our focus and we're looking at creative ways to bring more um more Federal funding into that effort absolutely and I've very much appreciated um parks's efforts in that regard too and and the work that we've done together um with Majority Leader Schumer as well to make sure that it's communities um that particularly lack tree canopy coverage that are prioritized when it comes to Ira funding that our city has received so thank you for for parks's leadership on on that front um going to the Federal grant programs in particular because I think you know one of the biggest things that we keep coming back to is we need more Investments um in in um our communities um in um this area in particular too and so one thing I wanted to ask was how will the city ensure that it gets its fair share of funding from the New York New York State Environmental Bond act thank you for the question and um highlighting the importance of the bond act which we're very much uh aware of and have been eagerly awaiting information about for the last uh many years we are U taking the the way in which we're preparing for the opportunity to apply is to be meeting with our state um de with our state counterparts that can give us any insight into the focus of the um of the opportunities uh in particular in the last month we submitted uh probably about 15 of potential projects through their survey opportunity so that we could get feedback on what kinds of uh projects they might be receptive to funding um we also have focused very much on identifying some of the constraints that might hinder us from being successful in those applications some of which uh might relate to the time frame in which they would expect implementation um we've heard today about some of our challenges in procurement um and our overall Capital design schedules and we want to be competitive um with Upstate in any Capital programs for example we would apply for so it's very much on our mind um looking at what successful projects could be and if uh you all aren't able to receive that funding for whatever reason or there's other you know we don't get more through the IRA for example what are the contingency plans in place for the city um to still access funds that would be needed um for these resiliency programs thank you for the question uh that's focusing on funding obviously very critical we in in some ways um our mindset is always uh to be uh maybe Scrappy and um really pursue all the opportunities uh that we can uh we're continuing uh through to explore grant opportunities specifically through the mayor's uh the deputy mayor's um Grant's task force uh that's been a way in which um we are sharing information across you know City agencies uh about opportunities um we're U continuing to pursue grants uh grant opportunities uh from federal agencies like uh Noah National Oceanic um and Atmospheric Administration we've done that for years and continue to do so as well as pursue opportunities uh from the US Environmental Protection Agency they've funded many of our uh projects that have contributed to us understanding the conditions in particular for our Wetlands over the last 10 years uh We've um are continuing to look at other state programs that have uh always well for for decades really funded uh projects um both capital projects and um stewardship and job training projects so uh we can provide you just to give you a um more thorough understanding of U what we've accomplished in the last 10 years what that those lists of Grants are and what we have coming down the pike but we are continue to actively pursue that and have at at any given time you know more than a dozen projects that are Grant funded and more than a dozen that are that we're pursuing on that scale commissioner um just just to clarify were you focused on resilience projects and Parks or more more G uh I parks in particular with my question but also if you if you do have um you any comments on uh resiliency projects in general too very happy to hear about I'll just reiterate that um you know when we don't get Federal money either we have to take money out of C City uh City uh tax levy um for things like Coastal resilience currently um or for storm water projects we have to raise the water rate got it thank you um now going back to uh to Parks a bit uh you know one of the things that I'm I just have a few more questions and I'm going to turn it over to my colleagues one was uh you know on September 29th when this when the storm uh happened and you know I one thing that really struck me both in walking my kids to school and seeing the into flooding that morning and then over the course of the day uh was I maintain that our parks and tree canopy have such an essential role to play um in absorbing storm water um in incorporating green infrastructure um to to assist with the issue of major flooding that we've seen um with this storm uh with Ida before um you know my district in particular Queens Boulevard places like that that were extraordinarily flooded could really benefit um from from more creative infrastructure from Parks and otherwise um to uh to address the flooding that we see in the rain so I'm just curious since this is our first time talking since um that that storm how has Parks thought about um not so much it its response yes but also proactively looking into the future perspectively what thoughts have you all had about how Parks could play a role in addressing this issue and protecting us from the next climate emergency um what was your thinking before how has it changed um what other measures do you see as um critical that could be implemented now when the next storm comes which it will thank you for the question uh we are in some ways always looking at um storm water response uh throughout our Parks system and both incorporating green and gray um infrastructure so I'll go back to um just focusing on for a minute the kinds of formal green infrastructure that um collaboration that we've had uh with D um and then just mention some of our other um approaches so we've worked with d on expanding green infrastructure um in for storm water capture since 2011 and we've are continuing to sort of bolster that program both through retrofits uh in our parks to capture both the impervious area within um our Park property as well as um in previous area on the street uh through a number of programs um retrofitting um Parks adding green infrastructure components into n Park projects and um i' pursuing grants to expand uh more our ability to do more creative green infrastructure projects um we've got for example a um a number of projects in Staten Island uh that wouldn't have otherwise come under uh other funding programs so that we can expand our own ability within um our design and construction teams to implement uh projects that capture storm water in our from our own assets as well as from the streets so that continues um to be a big Focus we've got um dozen moving towards you know hundreds of uh projects that are in design and that will come online over the next several years so with that um roll out of programs we are always increasing our um capacity and ability to uh be creative to to speak to that um component and um I think you'll see in the testimony that there are a number of um project uh types of programs that we're of course partnering on with d whether it's uh cloudburst programs that happen in Parks or or blue belt programs um that in in um to speak to some of our other elements of um you know attention to having resilient Parks I mean that's uh part of the reason we pay such close attention to the type of uh tree planting we do How We Do It um and doing it right whether both on the street um or in the natural areas and increasingly with you know over the last 10 years um an understanding of the climate change um and the the likelihood of having more resilient plant um species uh coming from the south we're actually looking very carefully at our plant pallet and so that's an ongoing uh effort it's not uh it's not you know something that we're suddenly thinking about you know since last week or even since Ida and then um lastly I'll just say that uh it's uh particularly important um that that we understand the critical aspect of Maintenance whether it's maintaining you know the vegetation um maintaining rain Gardens um ability to clean out catch basins after a storm but um it it goes back to being able to do and have the resources to do the work on the ground to make sure these green infrastructure systems are ready for the next storm thank you and I just urge you all to really um to to to to keep that uh planning going because uh you know it's it's there's far more we have to to do on that front to think of our Parks you know as um fortifications against climate change so I'm heartened to hear the efforts and encourage them to keep going uh my final question is you know and and really for for both um parks and D is we're talking about all these issues that are so crucial uh measures that need to be implemented um requiring funding from all different levels of government um and we couldn't agree more with that at the same time we're looking at an Administration that's proposing drastic pegs um um that will cut from the very types of work and services uh including these that we need to fortify our city so uh my question for you all is how will the recently announced hiring frees um the pre proposals um phased in three times over the next year um by the mayor disrupt the city's climate resiliency projects well so let me start by saying uh at least in so far as far as D is concerned the water utility portion of D's budget which is a little more than 90% of our budget and includes all of the storm water and sewer work is not subject to the peg we are subject to the otps free and we are subject to the hiring freeze but we're not uh subject to the Peg and of course we are doing everything we possibly can to uh ensure that none of our services are hurt or slowed down uh by that but we are working through the the two freezes that we are subject to thank you commissioner and I just add that it's it's there there's a disconnect there between um the work that you all need to be doing and are doing and getting the appropriate funding from our own city government to do so if we expect the federal government and the states to step in then our city needs to be the first mover to act and put that funding in um especially when it comes to resiliency projects um for Parks you know I'd asked the same question of you as well assistant commissioner and with really a focus on for Parks you mentioned maintenance and how important that is too so how would these pegs how are you all thinking about these pegs how will they affect maintenance and operations um especially for Parks um that are smaller and don't have the private Conservancy resources that depend on city funding well I'm actually not prepared to answer that and I think as an agency I don't think we're quite ready yet either um we'll be working with om and um working with our budget office to identify how to best respond so we're we're committed to maintaining The Parks at a at a standard that um we've always held and I'll continue to do so but um we won't have any specific response uh until the November plan comes out and that at that time sure thank you and I would just add again uh we're we're in a conversation about cutting from Parks and green spaces that are crucial for our health crucial for our climate the conversation should really be about how to increase resources for our parks department and so to see pegs being proposed by this Administration that will give you all fewer resources to maintain our green spaces fewer resources to make our Parks more resilient in the face of a worsening climate crisis worsening floods uh is shocking um and doesn't comport with what the work that we know needs to be done uh to actually invest in our Park system uh on that note I'll turn it over now for questions from our colleagues uh the first one is uh council member Brooks Powers thank you chairs and thank you um commissioner for your remarks as you know in my district last week we saw a flooding due to mesh that was left on top of catch basins on construction corridors but that mesh was unfortunately not removed prior to the flooding at these locations how is DP addressing this issue in advance of future floodings also how frequently does d Clean Catch basins can you walk through what the protocols are in place to ensure catch basins receive the necessary maintenance and cleaning and finally in 2018 the mayor made a commitment of $2 billion towards improving sewer infrastructure in southeast Queen neighborhoods can you provide an update on the progress of that project and is there any plans on Expediting those that particular project because we see these now frequent weather events happening where not only the places that have um been queued up for or that have historically received flooding we're seeing new parts of queens that are receiving flooding as well and I know I said that was last but the last last is in the arbor Community along Beach 67 Street D came in and thankfully put infrastructure in that was supposed to suck up the water um from these weather events and to help prevent the flooding unfortunately the way it was built the pitch has created a dynamic where along thursby Bas in um excuse me thursby and Beach 67th there has been an uh a lot of flooding going into the homes we saw that in winter storm Elliot in December we saw that again last week with the rainwater it doesn't even really take those weather events if we have high tide if there's um light rain we are still seeing it so can DP come back revisit that site and do the necessary work to address that project that took place that now is impacting over a dozen homes along that strip um thank you council member I'll I'll U try to tackle these in reverse order regarding the specific project in arvor uh of course we'll have somebody come take a look I um I not going to commit we can fix it until we know what we think is going on but we will certainly work with your office well the challenge is some of those homes even before didn't get the level of flooding they've gotten now and the contract is that did it had acknowledged to some of the homeowners that it was not when they look back after the fact that it's not pitched correctly huh okay well we will as I said we'll we'll um we'll look into that particular site um in terms of Southeast Queens the work is proceeding uh I think as as I was saying in in my statement we are thinking broadly about how we can expand and accelerate storm water management work across the city so we don't have any specific plans right now to accelerate the work specifically going in on in southeast Queens but that is in the budget it is in the budget for all of the next 10 years so that work is slated to continue on I'm sorry to that point what will the city be doing in the meantime because we have homeowners that are being flooded we have people who live in the basement in those areas we have high water tables literally one of my home one of my residents in my district w woke up by standing up off her bed to get ready for work only to find that her feet was covered with water so as they wait for this construction project to take place what is the city doing to make sure that we are mitigating the flooding that's taking place well council member look as I as I said uh the reality is these are long-term projects right there is no matter no no no amount of Desire on our part could accelerate uh all of those projects at once um it's one of the reasons that we started last year only a couple of months after this Administration took office rainfall ready which is really as as I have characterized it it's the Band-Aid um you know a Band-Aid is what you put on a wound while nature slowly heals the wound but you protect it from getting worse right and so what that includes for example is uh the the distribution of flood barriers which are not a unique technology you can buy them at Home Depot we give them out uh you know in part to help people in part to make sure people know that that that technology exists so people who have particular uh flooding issues through their driveway through a front door you basically it's it's like a sandbag that's easier to store because you can empty the water out and and refill it and Advance the flood and we thank you for it you did give that to my district as well as some pumps and we are appreciative of that uh the the sum pumps that we've started uh Distributing in in certain circumstances uh we have um flood alarms so just like you have a smoke alarm uh we uh would encourage anybody who lives in a basement apartment you can get a uh flood sensor so that uh your constituent would have wouldn't have woken up with the surprise she would have heard the alarm to let her know when flooding is starting um pursuant to uh a local law my agency is working now on a a study around Backwater uh preventors um so that is I I will have more to say in a couple of months on that score certainly before the end of the year um so there are a number of things and finally of course it's about um getting flood insurance which I know is a financial challenge to some um but nonetheless it is just a reality uh that the city is not going to be able to protect everybody in the near- term we are working as hard as we can to develop a comprehensive approach but it will take time there is no no way around it um you ask about catch facing one point on that there are some homeowners or residents that have flood insurance and were told by their insurance carrier that they would not be covering it well that I that is something that I think perhaps we should have a a follow-on conversation about we have heard of of complaints like that and uh of course it is the state that deals with um enfor foring good behavior among insurance companies but I think that's something I'd be happy to talk with you and your staff about thank you um you asked about catch Bas and cleaning so uh at the beginning of last fiscal year so last summer um D implemented something I think is is really very good which is a um a risk based approach to catch Basin inspections and cleanings so rather than treating all 160,000 of our catch Basin as equally likely to get clogged or equally impact ful if they do get clogged we actually developed a risk assessment so some uh catch basins that are on high traffic streets or near a subway station or something so we think they might be likely to get clogged very quickly or they would be really impactful if they flood they are actually getting uh checked every six months others that are uh for location reasons or others less likely to get clogged or less impactful if they do are on a three-year cycle that's a way that we optimize the impact of the labor hours that it takes physically to go around and check these um in advance of a storm so whenever the flash flood program is activated there are about 2,000 high priority catch basins that are allocated among D do and sanitation and so when the flash flood uh flash flood program is activated by the office of emergency management as it was on Thursday morning the 28th actually pretty early I think 8 AM um Crews go out and check those high priority locations and to the extent that it's possible we will go and clean them if they are clogged one of the things that I think we we are always eager to remind people of is there is a difference between clogging and covering right so if a catch Basin fills up with material the top has to be opened up it has to get scooped out that requires a special truck only D can do that um what often happens especially in the middle of a storm and I know of several places in the city where this happened on the 29th that when the rain started sanitation Sweet Street s sweepers had done their job the catch basins were were fine all of that water especially during the during the Autumn brings leaves covers over mats over the catch basins and then you start getting flooding of course when we find out about that we do dispatch crews in the middle of a storm as long as it's safe and immediately right after to clear those spaces but I also know of several instances and um maybe even one or two people here who went out um in the middle of the storm identified locations like that all it takes is a rake and I think one opportunity we may have is to think about how we get New Yorkers to to do that kind of work that the reality is there is no way with massive increases in resources that D could respond in real time to 160,000 catch basins around the city so I think there is something around a distributed response and then you mentioned the meshes which you know you and I spoke about um the weekend of the 30th 31 uh you know those construction me meeses and these are this is actually a kind of a lining that basically uh prevents grit from going into the catch basins it's particularly I believe required in in the separately sewered areas of the city including uh your district and it is actually a State DEC requirement for construction so our plan is actually we need to talk to DEC um because one of the things that we think is probably necessary as a requirement on their part that the construction contracts include uh a commitment by the contractor when there is a flash flood warning to remove those meshes it is not something that D installs it's not even something the D mandates it is actually a state item so we will talk to them thank you for that thank you chairs thank you thank you council member we're joined by council member Nar CE uh happy to have her here with us um and I recognize council member nurse for questions um and um we didn't start the clock right away for the last um so yeah there was there was there there was extra time there but you know it's a majority whip thank you chair come on and um we recogniz we we recognize council member nurse for questions thank you chair um first of all congratulations and welcome um I want to um thank you commissioner for just the proactive Communications you've had at least directly with me um with regards to Heavy Rain events in Bushwick um and just just how commun how available and accessible you have been um to hear all of my gripes um and I do appreciate the short-term mitigation efforts that you all have been putting in in the recurring areas that are getting hit um in Bushwick however we're kind you know and I've said this at other hearings we're just at this point where people are demanding answers I'm aware of what you're saying because I'm here at the these hearings um but I think at this point what we're looking for is an as a timeline of when there will even be a proposal for what to do and I don't know it's hard to understand I understand that each one is each neighborhood that has this type of recurring flooding might have specific things that are unique to it but Bushwick needs to know where we are in that pipeline are we neighborhood 20 are we neighborhood three um is it in two years we will get uh a vision of a proposal just anything more concretely would be really helpful because we are the ones getting yelled at we are the ones getting the the brunt of the communications with which and the answers are not easy to communicate um and so we need just a little more transparency in terms of where we are in these projects excuse me um Council council member look it's a it's a very fair question certainly for your specific um issue with the flooding on nicer Bacher that that we've uh that you and I have walked through and uh um we've spent a lot of time there is active work going on right now uh around what the Alternatives could be um so I think we would have more to share with your constituents certainly before the end of the year um I don't know if that includes a firm timetable right um but we will certainly have more to say uh that that will it include um what the all the options are certainly it will include the options that we are exploring okay is there any uh funding dedicated to specifically to addressing the fun flooding in bushwig I think once we figure out exactly what the preferred option is um there there is so so it was alluded to I forget in in uh I think one of the chair's um opening remarks uh two billion dollars that was set aside in The New Normal report that is a pool of money that we could potentially draw from uh we will have to figure out where to pull that funding together from but you know realistically first we have to figure out what we're what we're trying to do I for what it's worth I'll say um in part because of the uh in part because of our our ability to have recourse to the water bill and in part because D has focused so much on our ability to do procurement and deliver capital capital availability is not our main constraint our main constraint is much more around the ability to design uh these projects at once I think you're all at the city council familiar with the challenges that New York City has had in attracting and retaining civil engineers yes which is not just about the city I hear that from every AE consultant out there right but that's one of our key bottlenecks thank you for that um I do think that you know I would really recommend that the city you know engage in uh louder Outreach on communicating that the timelines are far because you know the water barriers are nice if you have a hose um but I'm not seeing them being used actively we've given a lot of way we appreciate um them and it feels like something but it when when it actually is happening in real time it's it's not as effective um so I I think we need to have more robust Communications from the agencies or the administration like hey we don't have answers for you for two to three years and because people need to know that when they're investing in our communities um because it's not just for us it's not just nicker Boger we have public housing we have you know like a 20 you know 10 15 block radius where people are just whole floor is just useless um okay uh I'll move on another question I have is kind of in relation to the resolution um and I've asked about this a little bit before does d formally review uh land use or housing applications involving uh City subsidies that will be constructed within uh uh future high-risk flood [Music] zones I I will need to see whether de P has any role within that process I believe that would be undertaken by City Planning but I would um have to get back to you on that okay thank you chair thank you so much counc nurse uh next up is council member Carr thank you uh chairs janiro and Krishnan for this crucial hearing commissioner and it's good to see you and your colleagues all here um I just want to start by thanking D for its transformational Investments whether it's the form separate sewer infrastructure replacing septic and combined sewer over the last 30 years and of course Landmark blue belt Investments that have been just transformational for my communities even with current challenges um I just have three questions that I want to focus in on um the first is um with respect to the seaw wall project first forecasts were that it was going to start in 2018 and finish in 2021 and obviously that has been a mistake um and I know they're about to take over some blue belt Creations uh from DP near father capano so I'd love to hear your perspective on where things are and what needs to happen for this to move forward um additionally um I know that there is some blue Bel project expansions contemplated for South Beach and Grasmere but not yet in the capital plan I know you talked about that in the round but love to hear more specifics about you know when that might come about and then finally um with respect to the Westerly willbrook clove Lakes drainage study that's concluding this month and the options that are going to be presented from that I'd love to know a timeline of when we could start to see a timeline for something in particular for Horizon Village which has been devastated twice in the last 20 years by storms thank you all right um thanks council member I apologize I will have to get back to you on on both clove Lake and South Beach I just don't have those uh timelines at my fingertips um I know that as you say the clove Lake study is is winding down but I have not been briefed on what it's going to say yet so I I don't have any sneak peek to offer I'm sorry uh but happy to give you one in private sure um on the Southshore uh seaall that is something that uh has has occupied a fair bit of my attention personally I've spoken a congresswoman Malia takus about it personally um the uh um DEC commissioner basil seos uh and I have convened a number of meetings uh with the Army Corps with parks with national parks there are a number of agencies involved which is part of the problem right and I say that as an agency so we are sometimes part of the problem as well but the more agencies you have especially the more levels of government the more uh things drag on the good news is the first phase really is on the verge of issuing a contract um again I believe we've got somebody from the Army Court here so I won't make news for them you could ask them but uh I will simply assure you that getting that project underway has occupied a lot of my attention um a lot of commissioner seo's attention um I know Colonel young at the uh both Colonel young and Colonel Lloyd have been personally involved at the Army Corps so um we are on it what I will also say and I think I have learned a great deal uh from the problems that project has faced as we should apply to the Hat study right we need to think about the hats as being the Southshore of Staten Island project times 30 right um and so we have had issues with hazardous waste right as as you know there's a site there that's that's got radioactive waste that New York City has not actually got a track record of doing cleanups for so we are in a very thorny discussion with the federal and state governments about how to allocate responsibility for that we've had a very big issue that has caused caused significant delays and again I think this is a situation in which everybody's been working hard and everybody's been working in good faith but um because the Inland work is what's called a betterment the city is going to pay for it but also the city has to design it we have actually spent more than two years going back and forth with us sending them drawings and them sending them back and again I don't mean to say this as an attack or a criticism on the core I think they are working in good faith but everybody does things slightly differently so my agency has a really good track record of doing very big construction projects we don't do our designs in exactly the same way as the Army Corps does and so one of the things that was in as Elijah alluded to our recommendations and our input into the army corp's hat study and something frankly I've begun to talk to our Congressional Delegation about with respect to the upcoming water resources and defense authorization act which is happens every two years in Congress WTA um is actually about expanding the mission of hats so that not because we need the feds to pay more I think New York City should pay its fair share but because that division of design work is a killer and if we think about hats which is going to have not only multi climate hazards with Inland flooding that it has to address uh sunny day flooding that it's going to have to address from sea level rise but also things like recreation parks access access to fairies things like that the hats project like is going to be some of the most complex Waterfront work imaginable and if we wind up in a situation in which there are multiple agencies trying to design it together that is a recipe for delay that will add multiple decades to what is already a multiple decades program thank you let's catch up offline about that that's very important thank you chairs thank you thank you Council car uh I recognize councilman wrestler for questions thank you very much Cher jaro it's good to have you back and thank you to you and Cher Krishnan for your leadership on this hearing it it could not be more pressing and important and thank you to the administration officials for joining us today I'd like to just Begin by building off of chair krishnan's final comments about how we can anticipate these pegs to impact resiliency efforts uh across the city uh commissioner do you think you can realistically achieve the kind of Ambitions that you've set out with 15% pegs kind of uh over your head and if uh the other panelists would like to comment on how devastating these Draconian Cuts would be on your ability to effectively do your work we would welcome any any insights that you have to offer um well council member I'll I'll just start by by reiterating because our because D is funding and so the funding for storm water is water utility and we could save a a ton of money and it still can't be used for other other City purposes of course um D has not been subject to the peg so storm water resilience is not affected by the peg we are subject to the hiring frees and we are working with om in the hopes of getting exemptions from those uh from the hiring fre and there is this proc process around otps spending that has been frozen um and so we're trying to figure out how to unfreeze key categories there anything else you'd like to add about how you can navigate these extraordinary CS uh similar to uh what what parks also said we're we're in the process with om and and figuring this all out so um you know I just want to be clear climate change Remains the single greatest threat to the people of New York City we have to be deepening these Investments the prospect that across the board deep Cuts could impact our ability to make these necessary resiliency Investments and frankly much much more is and frankly much much more is and frankly much much more is um indefensible and I I I greatly hope that the mayor and B director uh will recognize that this is an area that must be spared from any potential Cuts uh just building on council member nurse's line of questioning similarly I think we're looking for Clarity on when we're going to see more comprehensive planning that can realistically provide protection for our communities and my recollection is that plan NYC requires we're now calling it plan NYC again is that the so not plan YC plan NYC oh I prefer plan YC if you don't mind but I also have a silent myps days it was plan YC I just was unsure where we were so under planyc we'll go with that um dp's required to release a storm water flooding adaption adaptation plan by 2024 and want to understand will this plan include Target improvements for specific areas that the city knows well flood and flood consistently what I certainly experience in Council District 33 which is Waterfront District is that it's the areas uh that flood when it rains a little that are absolutely decimated when it rains a lot and yet we don't see improvements we with all due respect commissioner I I Adore your staff I spend time and time again on the phone with them looking at sites they say they're going to make improvements they're never adequate and we continue to have enormous challenges and I don't know if it's the reticence to take on big lengthy capital projects that are obviously very costly but we're not seeing the interventions that are needed in the places on Dean Street and borm Hill on through and wab about and South Williamsburg New and mol and greenp point I mean these are the sites that everybody knows always flood Fourth Avenue in along Carol where shahan and I border they flood constantly and yet I don't see anything getting better how do we shift how do we do better is that going to be laid out in this plan next year how do how do I be a better advocate for my neighborhoods to actually see the Investments that we need uh well look council member I I we have been certainly for the last year and a half or nearly two years now we have been trying to shift gears at D to really focus on resilience as the driving force of a lot of our Capital thinking um for example uh we released the rainfall ready Maps last summer um that was new right that was the result of a lot of work some of it done at MJ uh under the previous administration um but that was new we are now in the process among other things of using those hotspots where we know there is flooding to guide our Capital prioritization right that is not not actually the way it had been done uh for Generations at D um so you know much like bringing kind of data driven rationality to how we do catch Bas and inspections um we're we're beginning the process of bringing that kind of risk or or impact uh prioritization to how we think about Capital Investments to address flooding among the big things that is just about ready or we're beginning to use it now but has been a major investment over the last year or two um is building what we call an all pipes model so we now have I won't call it a digital twin it's not quite that fancy but really for the first time we now have a model of how all of the sewers interconnect um that's really important because what we know first of all it's all interconnected and so among the things that we are now just at the at the early stages of being able to do is understand well if there's flooding down here the fastest most cost away cost effective way to address it might not be there it might be Upstream because all the water up here is Flowing down here it may also be that if there's flooding up here the real problem is a bottleneck down here we now have the ability to really understand that and one of the things that I think we are coming to terms with as an agency is the fact that until until the weather started changing a couple of years ago we didn't need to worry about this that much we just didn't have to understand it right and now we do um and so we are building the infrastructure so that we can do that kind of rational planning yes we are working towards a comprehensive strategy I do not I am not yet able to tell you how detailed or specific that will be what I can tell you is that we are working on it with a large team with a lot of interbau and in fact inter agency work going on it is something that is one of my top priorities it is not coincidental that the mayor asked me to be Chief climate officer and commissioner at DP um at the same time it's precisely to make sure that we are fully integrating DP into this and of course we will be bringing uh we will be standing up this Bureau of coastal resilience in part because one of the things we've realized and not realized but one of the things we are acting on um is the reality that the first place that uh tidal flows go is down the drain and one of the things which we certainly saw on the 29th one of the issues that caused even more flooding than that massive rainstorm the second most intense rainstorm in the city's recorded history brought us was the fact that the hour of most intense rain from 8: a.m. to 9:00 a.m. unfortunately took place at high tide and so we had a number of parts of the city where our outflow which otherwise would have drained water out of the city into the harbor actually were backed up because the tide had risen so high that they were covered over so among the things we have to work on is and I'm sorry chair I'm but I I want to give a complete answer I sore to give given a time I thought that chair Krishna promised me double the time today I must have misunderstood but uh but among the things that we are we are working on is how to accelerate the tide Gates so that we can prevent flooding from occurring because water is backing up which is something for example that happens regularly unfortunately in the rockco look and it's this is interconnected to to some of the proposals that were included in the Hat study it's I will just say I thought I appreciated the the Army Court engaging with us as a communities across the city in a quite open and thoughtful way I could never understand what the city's position was throughout this process and so I struggled to understand what the city was advocating for my community was organized we were pushing we were very concerned about 15t walls that would um you know create a bathtub effect and cut our communities off from our waterfronts but I'd really like to better understand maybe with new leadership we can have those conversations uh in the mayor's office to to have Clarity on what you're all advocating for and I'll just say in closing because I've gone over time in part because you gave such a thoughtful um and lengthy response uh I appreciate a data- driven approach to identifying the where we need to make the Capital Improvements to improve our sewer infrastructure I don't have the data but I know the lived experience of my neighbors and I can tell you the places in my community that are hit time and again and again and we will provide that list once again to D and be the squeakiest wheel that I know how to be but we desperately want to see attention and intervention in these sites that are problematic sites so look for an email from me very shortly but you know hope we can work together to make some improvements in our Waterfront District thank you thanks so much councilman westler a lot of leeway there on that one um council member Holden thank you chairs and I I want a link and wrestler time also I get man once you start slippery slope I'm on both committees so we should do we should get extra time thank you thank you Comm thank you chairs and thank you commissioner um two questions regarding storm water runoff um one problem uh I have a lot of utility work in my district many blocks and I brought this up to to De uh DP many times especially National Grid they're putting replacing gas lines on the sidewalk when they restore the sidewalk they pave the whole thing including the strip that's not the property owners space that's the city space used to be a grass strip now we have concrete which is counterproductive if we're doing you know the the BIOS swes or the rain Gardens and then we're Paving over blocks and blocks in districts around queens and throughout the city that's one where I do have pending legislation that would actually Define that space that you can't pave over it it hasn't been drafted yet I'm waiting several weeks or months and but I think that could be part of your plan to to mitigate some of the because obviously the the storm water runoff that we're experiencing experiencing now in my district it goes into the New Town Creek and we know what that's like the New Town Creek is is another story but um the second thing the The Yards text amendment of 2008 that this Council passed it's really not being enforced properly by do I see every every construction project in my district I almost every one of them I have to address meaning somebody's not paying attention at dob if they're permitting this you know they're allowing it I send inspectors down there from do and most of the time they come back to they didn't find anything wrong and I know this so I have to send another inspector and depending on which do inspector I they send I get lucky sometimes most of the time I'm spinning my wheels that means and this is by the the way there's been articles about this for since 2008 about how the do is not really enforcing it so we need to pull all this together my question would be number one on the on the The Yards text amendment can D actually help out and kind of guide do OB because I don't know again if they if they're really educating their inspectors properly and I'll speak to the commissioner of do also but questions one would be would you get involved in that in helping because that I'm telling you almost every project that I'm seeing in my district that they're Paving over because they want to park more cars and it is and they're putting in everywhere they're putting in their cars in front of their their Stoops in their doorways which I'm trying to get you know do to enforce that that's almost impossible and I'm actually reaching out to the fire department because that seems to be you're blocking egress you know so all these so all these questions we need help from your a or somebody's help on this um thank you uh council member um look I will uh so the the issue of the text Amendment enforcement is something that that I I certainly know is a challenge um I I think it is worth having a conversation that I would be happy to engage with commissioner adto about in terms of how we think perhaps differently about enforcement I don't know whether that would require a legislative change or or an inter agency agreement we would need to think about how we resource something like that because we you know I think one of the things frankly that tends to happen is that we assign tasks based on who has resources or who has expertise as opposed to oppos to which agency is really focused on ensuring that a bad thing doesn't happen um and uh and there may need to be some realignment there but but just on on dealing with inspectors that don't know the law that's one thing it's another thing because I'm always talking to homeowners and they're complaining they're getting flooded they're their sewers are backing up and I said well look at your neighbors I I said part of the problem is if you look at your even your uh property you've paved over 90 or 100% of your your your yard and that's causing it well no it's I said it's overdevelopment but it's we're concreting everything we're we're we're cementing grass but when the city actually does it when the city participates in that like I mentioned about the grass strip it may not seem like a lot but when you look at entire blocks of my district and I photographed this and I did give it to D I said let's do something about this let's stop doing this let's put more grass and with again if it takes legislation I'll do it uh however it shouldn't really it because it's not really the property owner's space there they most of the properties it ends at the sidewalk and then you have that strip of it could be four feet it could be more in certain areas so if we can coordinate that and kind of quickly because that's they're replacing you know Miles and Miles every day and and it's National Grid and and ConEd that that are doing it and each time I talk to them they say you know we we don't know anything about that we we'll we'll PVE and they're Paving it and it's not their property it's not it's the city's property but we can control that thanks and I just want to jump in for a second I just want to give uh Bob a little latitude because this an important question and I I think we all see it and so I'm going to give him a little latitude ude here and he also sits next to me at the council so you know they yeah I could I could harass you sometimes on that but no this is this is important so R take as long as you want to um give an answer to that um well look on on this one I uh I would I I will confess it's not something that I have an answer to uh off the top of my head but I'm happy to to work with you it's something that I've I've heard in the past how we enforce construction rules across the city frankly we mention it in plan YC is something that we've got to have happen it's something that is part of uh the um city of yes for carbon neutrality that's I believe coming before the city council very soon um but on the specific issue of what conad and and National Grid might be doing on the sidewalks I I will follow up with you thank you thank you commission thank you Council M Holden uh I recognize council member Vasquez hi and thank you commissioner um thank you for your work so listening to my colleagues and they questioning uh I can't help but ask you a lot of these would be facilitated better with buau Commissioners and so why hasn't uh DP hired any buau Commissioners yet um well thank thank you council member uh we um so the the position of burough Commissioners was actually legislated by the city council I believe uh two years ago so we have been in the process of getting ready and hiring and recruiting and and with the hiring frees we're a little bit stuck right now but um I'm hoping to work through that uh because I I agree with you among the themes that we've heard here is better communication and that is something that um you know I have a my Deputy Commissioner for public affairs and Communications who's been doing a great job but is trying to build her team um and and we could use those extra resources do we expect that to be done within this calendar year or again there's the hiring frees right now and and om is working through the exception requests and and uh I don't have any I don't have a timeline I can give you right now perfect thank you for that um you had mentioned earlier the D risk assessment um is there a way that we as council members can get what that looks like in our district I I know certain parts of my district every single time that there is flooding and and you've seen it not just the flooding but also the sink holes that happen afterwards specifically in my district because of the construction in the 20s um is there a way to get that information to us well one of the things that I you know again in with a with a more structured approach to outreach that I would love to be able to do is ensure that and council member wrestler's question kind of Incorporated this ensure that our uh rainfall ready map that we're really relying on incorporates all of the kind of lived experience out there you know I've been very pleased when I go out um you know as I as I did with you and in your district and with others and across the city and and we talk to constituents who have experienced flooding our map is usually accurate but it's not 100% necessarily and and before we make decisions on it we'd like to incorporate all of that I would like to do that in a systematic way we haven't started that yet um and I think frankly it's it's um kind of just how we sequence the work uh I I really cannot stress enough how daunting the challenge of the city's uh storm water management is it is a breathtakingly complex uh system and so right now we've prioritized looking at a a number of known a very finite number I will point out um number of locations that we think typify the kind of problems that we see much more broadly around the city to identify how some of the solutions might work so that we can figure out by extrapolation what would a Citywide response actually involve that's that's really step one um which is in part why I you know frankly had to hedge a little bit with council member wrestler's question because I don't know how prec precise next year's plan is going to be but it is certainly going to be a step in the right direction I appreciate that because I I have so many local groups who are willing and able to come and help with the cleaning at least of the catch Bas on the surface area and so if we can just find those areas that we need to Target especially on days that we know are going to be significant uh with with significant uh rainfall then we want to be ready as well and if we can just Target those areas as a community we can actually spare a lot of the work that you guys uh would have to do as well so that way like we got to work together and this is a pathway to that um you had mentioned flood alarms as a recommendation to uh council member Brooks Powers is there an opportunity there to launch a city-wide program to cover for uh families uh that uh have a s a significant low-income bracket to where we're actually like saving their lives do you see a benefit for this um well so so the good news is these are not very expensive devices right I I don't have a number off the top of my head but we're not talking about a $50 or $100 um item uh and DP has some that we are very happy to give away we haven't done that in a systematic Citywide way but it is something worth exploring all right thank you that's all my questions thanks so much council member and now we have council member naris thank you chair good afternoon everyone and by the way you're one of the important agency in my life because I represent the 46 District um it been a problem for us even worse ever since Sandy um every little rain all the calls that I'm getting and usually I have to be on the street Riding the Storm to go around and visit folks in my district which is Garrison Beach uh Bergen Beach canari uh meal Basin area so you know where I'm talking about right so um in my district it's every day that it when I see Ren I have to cross my little finger so what can we do what's in plan to um to ease our pain in in this District because we talking about sewage backup I witness feces coming to people's home so I'm wondering where we at and before we get to that answer we have infrastructure money out there from the federal level how many proposal that you you have forth in front of the federal to make sure that we get our fair share in the city of New York um I will ask uh Elijah to give you some of the numbers around Federal let me take uh a couple of as a as I said earlier one of our challenges with Federal money is um and frankly I've had this conversation with a number of members of our our Congressional Delegation is that they believe that well if New York City is going to get EX or New York State's going to get develon um that we've been you know that we get by formula what BBG resilience money is going to be invested um and we have been very successful very successful very successful very successful very successful very successful very successful very successful facilities um that so that's that's been very successful uh I'll see if we can get back to you either right now or or later with a number on or later with a number on or later with a number on or later with a number on government has a competitive program that they are has a competitive program that they are has a competitive program that they are huge amount of water infrastructure money federal government that the state has determined New York City should not have access that the state has determined New York City should not have access that the state has determined New York City should not have access by by infrastructure uh which I think is unfair we have unfair we have unfair we have unfair we have maximize Federal money um and I think where um and I think where um and I think where um where the deck is not stacked against um you asked about um you asked about I want to know are there any I want to know are there any uh to know where these things are happening these things are happening um these things are happening um these things are happening um done a pretty good job over the last decade of reducing we have fewer than half as many sewer backups uh as we did as many sewer backups uh as we did as many sewer backups uh as we did it's still too many um one it's still too many um one of is that actually more than half of the sewer backups that are not due to what's going on are not due to what's going on so when a sewer backup is reported costs a significant amount of time in money costs a significant amount of time in money causing their own sewer backups because what we is a lot of situations in which uh the rain got Earth it line and in a major rainstorm like we and in a major rainstorm like we that kind of pressure behind the sewer that kind of pressure behind the sewer is actually liable to cause is actually liable to cause to the home and I and I think to the home and I and I think to the home and I and I think backup complaints where we send a truck there is no evidence backed up so there should not have been a sewer backup backed up so there should not have been a sewer backup because you've got a rain gutter because you've got a rain gutter parts of your District uh or put a rain barrel underneath it and then you've got the and then you've got the benefit of and then you've got the benefit of as the rain barrel is designed to do and chair I know I'm pushing it but I heard about 160,000 catch Bas and throughout the city and you have about 2,000 that's kind of like uh high priority area so do you have a list of where the high priority areas are and in the catch Basin and in the catch Basin and in the catch basin water flooding all because every if you want to checking all because every if you want to check calling me left and right I I I cannot sleep when is um heavy rain so when it's a stor forget it so I need your help commissioner I don't want to squeeze because I went out of my time but I need your help in my but I need your help in my but I need your help in my agencies like EPA Noah FEMA through the brick which were specifically um targeting that work an application to get more resources to get more resources I appreciate you and I'm hoping um so we can do some seminars together something got to be done because those people actually are in needs because like I said last last week again I had to go all over Garrison Beach and seeing people's houses under the flood that's unfair and having the backups from the sewage system that's from the sewage system that's from the sewage system that's uh the speed of projects and and um I guess the way I see it the way I see it the way I see it our challenge is not not wanting to do the right thing it is not even a lack of capital because once we have projects identified I have a 30 1 billion 10-year Capital plan at D capital is not really the main constraint um if we choose to prioritize I mean I don't I don't think we've had a lot of instances where or blue belt or cloudburst projects have been delayed I you know they in the popular imagination there's a lot that we blame uh environmental impact statements on uh for which is not necessarily the issue here um it I'm I'm just pointing out I'm I'm just pointing out where's the 22nd project it's how do we push all of them through the pipeline as quickly as possible um some of that is just about having really good management and I could not be more proud of the work that my agency has done in terms of managing its procure in terms of managing its procure in terms of managing its procure good management internally right um but there are ways that city does that the city does for city does that the city does for city does that the city does for car it is and and obviously you know obviously you know we have to obviously you know we have to m we can we can certainly brainstorm about this at uh at uh over our next at uh over our next forward since and and you know the first just reiterate I think it what um really was a building off uh almost 10 years of work after that that was inspired and included and identified in the wetlands um strategy that we then used as the foundation for the further road map focusing on New York City par marks wetlands in the the wetlands management framework so I will just um just wanted to highlight that that many of the uh recommendations and uh including addressing the need to develop better Wetlands map was were something that we continued to work on through getting US EPA funding uh in numerous uh in numerous uh in numerous like I said I got I got I got I got Robert texting that's fine absolutely okay I I certainly appreciate that and um to close out this panel my team co-chair my team co-chair my team co-chair my team co-chair much uh chair janiro actually before I go with my my closing questions we have I've been joined by Council M Gutierrez um who I think has a guz um who I think has a construction of the actual development which is um in any of of the buildings and I really think it's I don't know what the exact terminology is but like kind of where it is there around bu can it floods but the actual buildings flood and so every single Lobby even if it's if it's not even a cloudburst will flood and so I'm curious what what is the communication with Nicha like what what is something that I can do in this instance I can do in this instance I can do in this instance I can do in this instance I'm just curious what your communication with Nicha looks like overall and some of these like what your communication with Nicha looks like overall and some of these like the some of the things that I can be elevating cuz it is it is a problem and some of these I mean I I represent Williamsburg houses it's the oldest development in Brooklyn oldest development in Brooklyn oldest development in Brooklyn oldest development in Brooklyn about resilience um as with everything at Nicha the resources are always far short of the actual need but I think uh overall if you look at the portfolio overall if you look at the portfolio overall if you look at the portfolio overall if you look at the portfolio 11 years ago at Hurricane Sandy they've made a lot of progress they've made a lot of progress they've made a lot of progress they've made a lot of progress was buildings that didn't have electricity didn't have away the the top priority that I think niga has wisely embraced is to make sure that when the water goes away there aren't the lingering problems um that is not to say they have solved everything and I don't think anybody at Nicha would say that they have solved everything uh I do think there sustainability and resilience team is really and resilience team is really and resilience team is really and resilience team is really barin houses I I don't carry the details in my head I'd be very happy personally to to follow up with you um and perhaps even talk to Nicha jointly thank you you are very confident in Nicha and yes we will we will follow up thank you so much that's all thank member Sandy nurse who had to leave um for Parks um assistant commissioner Council nur's first question is is Parks considering allowing experienced large community compost organizations like big reuse to compost on appropriate park lands sites well we do already have composting on Parkland sites at um at certain locations um I don't know if perhaps Sarah neelon my colleague might want to address that in any in any more detail can you please raise your right hand once I wrestle this chair there we go do you swear or firm to tell the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth today yes um yes um yes um yes um is about whether Parks cont contemplating you adding additional compost facilities is that correct organizations especially like big reuse to compost on the on the appropriate Park sites right right so appreciate the question this is definitely something that the agency has been talking about with um sanitation as far as you know managing their new um compost need with the influx of of with their work so I think it's something that the agencies are you know addressing together um we do know that there's such a huge demand of parks facilities facilities and there's other city land that might be appropriate like a more fullsome answer for you although I have a feeling that but I don't have the specifics for you sure I'll let Council M nurse know too and would be helpful to have more information on that point as well absolutely can do that thanks so much that concludes the questions from our uh panel anything else all right well thank you so much to all I will thank you so much to all I will thank you so much to all we very much appreciate it all right um what we'll do is we'll we'll call up about three um members of the public at a time for for Testimony um if you can we'd urge you to keep your testimony to uh two minutes and we'll start the clock as soon as you start speaking so our first three uh panelists are jimmyo ly Kelly and Robert kamacho shice palmo Lyn Kelly and robertt kamacho and and uh stay behind Okay okay so right we got that covered okay so right we got that covered okay okay okay okay why don't you start Adam good to see you um uh there were three names called and there's just

be testifying on behalf of Lyn Kelly who had to leave early um thank you chairs chrisan and Janeiro and committee members for having this important hearing which is very timely considering the Citywide flooding on September 29th I'm Lyn Kelly and I'm the executive director of the New York restoration project and co-chair of NYC parks and open space Partners Coalition today I'm testifying on behalf of the NYC parks and Open Spaces a coalition representing over 50 organizations that share ideas to address common challenges amplify advocacy efforts and offer technical assistance and guidance and service of an equitable guidance and service of an equitable answer to a complex situation in which human beings those cuts of 15% they could expect to see a devastating impact on our Park system which is still recovering from Cuts made during Co 19 and has fewer workers than it did before the pandemic this austerity plan only furthers societal division during a time when we should be building community and ensuring the availability of critical services to new and current critical services to new and current critical services to new and current critical services to new and current critical services to new and current tree canopy coverage achieving these goals are vital not only to make our city more sustainable and Equitable but also to combat the impacts of climate change the time to implement these measures has never been more critical these measures has never been more critical these measures has never been more critical city parks Foundation Al New York League of conservation voters and Emily Walker natural areas Conservancy thank you uh hi everyone uh my name is Alia Sumo and I'm the deputy director for New York City policy at the New York League of conservation voters thank you chairs Krishan and Janeiro and members of the par and members of the part budget to Parks nylcv is also a member of to each other parks and green spaces make up 14% parks and green spaces make up 14% Urban Forest canopy in the city and roughly half of the land managed by NYC parks is directly on the water yet New York City Parks receive less than 1% of the city's budget we cannot maintain our Park system increase our tree canopy or improve our Waterfront resiliency if we cut our Park budget all three coalitions show that over 600 organizations in the city support parks open space tree canopy Waterfront environmental justice and air quality emergencies and the heavy rainfall on the 20 Conservancy thank you to chairs Krishna and janaro and members and in particular our natural areas play a tremendous role in protecting and fostering a more resilient City when it comes to our our natural areas the data it comes to our natural areas the data it comes to our natural areas the data it comes to our natural areas the data nearly 70% of the carbon stored and 83% of the carbon sequestered by trees across the city there are almost 10 degrees cool there are almost 10 degrees cool hospital bills from pollution induced illness annually they provide $2.2 billion in recreational value $1.1 billion do in public health value and they soak up as much storm water as $580 Million worth of new green storm water infrastructure despite these benefits the stresses on our natural areas are tremendous and without appropriate public investments in their care we stand to lose these assets entirely we are deeply alarmed by the Citywide budget cuts that were announced in September the mandated 5% budget cuts now in effect will have a catastrophic impact on the ability of NYC parks to implement much of its work including critical care for our natural for including critical care for our natural for will no longer be implemented I also want to express I also want to express our concern I also want to express our concern I also want to express our concern one of nac's Trail maintainers is with us today in City Hall and I just want to note that her work exemplifies the kind of care that we should be performing for nyc's land and we're taking away crucial funding to help support that work funding to help support that work but also believe that the urgency of this moment requires us to speak out about further constraints on the budget for Parks parks in natural areas benefit the lives of every New Yorker from longtime residents to our most recent arrivals we understand that moments of Crisis demand hard choices from our electeds but we also believe that these choices should not come at the expense of shared resources that make our C of shared resources that make our city in climate crisis we call on our elected officials from every level of nyc's government to work together to restore their proposed budget cuts and prevent additional cuts to services that make our city stronger thank you that encourages New Yorkers to use and care for their neighborhood parks and open care for their neighborhood parks and open care for their neighborhood parks and open care for their neighborhood parks and open care for their neighborhood parks and open I encouraging the community to conduct water testing we Reve connecting children to their waterfronts will actively engage additionally we support resolution number 608 as the effects of climate change are rapidly threatening our city few New Yorkers can deny the absolute devastation caused by the many storms hitting our city city parks Foundation has been able to respond swiftly after respond swiftly after to reduce spending dangerously threatens our Park system brightens our Park system a brightens our Park system a brightens our Park system a NE support of um uh intro [Music] 1069 K Webster and Cory Hassen the New York restoration project the Sarah Ro

appreciate it Sarah Roosevelt Park uh Community Coalition it's a 40-year-old volunteer organization on the lower e side in Chinatown in New York City an environmental justice area and we're a Playfair member and um my Park is just a short ways from here I I I'm I have a lot of things I wrote um I will say that green spaces are the First Responders to severe climate impacts impacts that we know are not going to get better we know we we know we know we know somebody taking care of them heat island effect electricity uh isn't you can't do it in some tenament you can't have an AC uh we have homeless people who will never ever have air conditioning um in until um in until um in until you can uh plant other plants that are more resilient there are a lot of things we can do um can do um can do um your comments council member chrisan uh because this is untenable I mean parks are the places where all neighborhoods come together there are there are resiliency centers there there are uh worker resiliency centers if you don't pay Parks employees a decent wage with a with a real future what do you expect them to do so I really thank you um sorry whatever thank you thank you hello again um good afternoon my name is wen't you just here weren't you just here it's my stunt I have a twin brother so yeah you couldn't change a shirt put a hat on or yeah I should have got the fake yeah I should have got the fake York restoration project thank you for the opportunity to provide testimony again this afternoon chair Krishna and chair Janeiro and yrp is a proud member of the play fair Coalition a coalition of 400 organizations across the city advocating for the city's Park system and why system and wi system and why system and why our partners we are here today in opposition to administration's proposed austerity cuts of 15% which would devastate the already chronically underfunded and understaffed New York City Parks climate change is at our doorstep only 12 12 days ago NYC was ravaged by flooding underscored the need for the city to invest in proven Solutions and green infrastructure such as parks waterfronts and open space Parks can reduce water runoff by 90% And filter out as much as 95% and filter out as much as 95 flooding and erosion nrp's work with the living Shoreline at Sherman Creek Park in Northern Manhattan is creating wetlands and oyster habitats which are protecting shorelines and uh providing natural defense enses against flooding for the community nrp's investment in his critical green infrastructure also allows for public Waterfront access while improving the ecological health of the park something too rare in New York City especially in underserved communities these new wetlands are storing carbon and removing nitrogen from Waters at surprisingly High rates this mean Parks have been operating with an austerity budget for 50 years an underfunded parks department means less maintenance workers and pep officers who keep the parks clean and safe nyc's forested areas soak up as much as storm water as 580 million worth of new green storm water infrastructure New York City's natural areas are 4 to 6 degrees cooler than the average temperature during extreme heat events extreme hit heat events extreme hit heat events extreme hit heat events here go yep okay there we go okay there we go okay there we go hi uh thank you so much for holding this hearing my name is Annie caror I'm the climate Justice campaign manager representing we act for environmental justice we act for environmental justice green spaces and access to the Waterfront are not equably distributed across the city access to Green spaces is on average much lower in environmental justice neighborhoods that are already plagued by adverse health problems and high levels of pollution low-income communities have 21% less park space 21% less park space 21% less park space cuts of 5 to 15% will further decrease perent will further decrease percent will further decrease percent will further decrease workers that live in environmental justice communities who are disproportionately black and Latin neck and who need green space in park space the most I

       "\"yeah I should read this more closely before I get up here right all in favor okay um okay thank you Lincoln that is why in 2009 along with my colleagues and the and the council I passed local La 31 requiring the mayor's office of long-term planning and sustainability now known the mayor's office of climate environmental justice to draft a comprehensive Wetlands protection strategy for the city the overall the overall goals of which were to conserve protect enhance restore and expand the city's wetlands and to standardize its approach to Wetlands management this law this Law requires a drafting and publication of a report to be submitted to the commissioner of D and the commissioner of parks and recreation no later than you know July 15 209 with an update published no later than July 15th every second year thereafter since then meaning since the bill was since the law was passed only one report has been published in relation to this law in 2012 in 2016 and 2021 the natural areas conserv in conjunction with the parks department released the wetlands management framework for New York City but is unclear if those documents are meant to satisfy the requirements of local La 31 this reporting requirement created by local law is not a suggestion it is the law again this is not this Administration this is another Administration so you know uh the the the this Administration must do what due diligence in publishing and submitting the required report in a timely manner and not when and not whenever it deems convenient but that's not this Administration I would like to thank the great committee staff whove done such great work over the years committee councils samaris Swanson and CLA McLaughlin policy analy policy analyst Ricky cha and Andrew borne financial analyst Andrew Lane Lawless finally my legislative director Navi core for all of their hard work let me recognize a member MERS of the Environmental Protection resiliency and waterfronts committee who are here have council member Holden council member wrestler council member men council member nurse council member Hanks is joining us on Zoom before I turn it over to my uh co-chair just a you know a little bit of housekeeping um uh there's this uh you know phenomenon that's been creeping up in some Council hearings lately where Witnesses ask questions of the panel we don't answer questions so we're here to hear from you we ask you questions so any questions directed us would be ruled out of order by me and we also want the uh testimony we have a lot of witnesses to be on topic uh you know we understand that people are passionate about funding for Parks uh this is not a budget hearing um you know we this Council stands squarely in favor of uh you know tree canopy development that's why in the last stated meeting a couple of days ago we passed the uh you know botcher Bill to require the 30% of canopy um of course the challenge is to figure out how to pay for that and a lot of people are here to talk about that this is not a budget hearing so it's just like we get that the 30% number is really important you know we'll let folks make their point but um generally speaking we want to stay on topic we have the we have the we have the oversight topic we've got the we got the bill and we got the reso and we want Focus testimony on those so um so I was just a bad guy Shaker so you don't have to say any of that stuff okay and with that it is my great privilege to um recognize my esteem co-chair uh uh chair shik Krishna chair of the parks committee I recognize chair Krishnan thank you so much chair Jano uh it's an honor to co-chair this hearing with you and good afternoon everyone I am council member Shaker Krishnan chair of the committee on Parks and Recreation and I'd like to thank my fellow co-chair Council Morano for agreeing to hold this joint hearing today uh which unfortunately um comes with very good timing given the recent events um in New York City on uh just a couple weeks ago when it comes to our climate the climate crisis is here we all know that all too well and painfully so and its effects threaten the well-being of all New Yorkers one of the more immediate effects which has been particularly damaging to the city this year as we know is flooding these flooding events most recently including tropical storm ofilia were rain events that laid bare the inadequacy of the city's infrastructure to handle massive rainfall once again large areas of the city that had never seen significant flooding before were shockingly underwater and once again this past summer where a multitude of severe weather events have occurred throughout the world this has set a new unfortunate milestone for being the hottest summer on record over and over again the storms the flooding the events that are considered once in a hundred years are happening once every year every couple years and it's a signal of how urgent the climate crisis is right here in our city we are a city surrounded by water and so the necessity for New York to be ever prepared for these increasingly harsh storms is growing more and more important despite these climate change events however there is still time though the clock is ticking to prepare and adapt our infrastructure structure to better handle what will continue to come our way in the future our focus at today's joint hearing will be on how the city's parks and wetlands can best be adapted to mitigate the effects of climate change such as flooding and extreme heat there is still time to prepare and adapt our infrastructure to better handle what will continue to come our way in the future particularly by increasing the use of green infrastructure and making making our Parks more resilient the city's Green Space can be adapted to expand the resiliency features such as through the use of expanding the green streets program building more rain Gardens in areas that are starved of Green Space broadening the reach of Park features to their surrounding neighborhoods building more parks and playgrounds with bio swes green features and permeable surfacing converting unused or abandoned land into Green Space and of course maintaining and expanding the city's tree stock there are important pieces of legislation that we've passed in this Council to address these issues and expand Green Space where none has existed before on top of that just last week our city council and the week before passed historic legislation to invest in and expand our tree canopy and of course we've also looked at ways to increase and improve water safety in our city too which is just as much a part of the climate crisis as as every other emergency that we face all of those things are crucial but I also want to call attention to the fact that we will not be able to make our city environmentally resilient until we invest in our Park system the way it should be and we will not have a park system that reflects in resources the value it holds for all of us from a climate standpoint to our health and wellbe being we will not have a park system with the resources that reflect that value until we achieve at least 1% of our city budget for Parks something that we need to do not only because it is crucial for our city it is crucial for climate change but it is also our city catching up with every other major city in the United States our parks are essential to our health and well-being the parks department has been heavily part of this process specifically to address climate change specifically when they developed resiliency guidelines in November 2017 entitled design and planning for flood resiliency guidelines for NYC parks which is part of the broader plan NYC framework the guidelines serve as a manual for planners designers and communities to reference while planning and developing coastally resilient parks and Waterfront spaces in particular the guidelines discuss certain Beach and Boardwalk best practices including the development of a plan for necessary Beach nourishment to ensure the best possible performance during and after a storm elevating boardwalks to be higher than the 100-year flood plane and the usage of concrete planks set on top of concrete and steel piles to create stronger and more resilient boardwalks I'm curious to see how this has informed the process by which the parks department has developed and renovated its various properties to become more resilient and whether recent storms have altered in any way how the department thinks about its resiliency planning I'd like to ensure this joint hearing explores and clarifies some points relating to parks and resiliency as well including how Federal funding from the infrastructure and jobs Act and the inflation reduction act are being allocated to enhance Parks resiliency work this Federal funding plays a crucial role in supporting our parks and green spaces I'd also like to hear more about the role that Parks will play in the climate strong Community project and the progress that has been made in implementing practices from the wetlands management framework and also how Parks will adapt to as I mentioned before the unacceptable budget cuts that mayor Adams has recently proposed in a way that not only cuts from our Parks vital services but also to understand how they will affect any resiliency projects the time to act is now we must urgently work to address this climate crisis and invest in the parts of our infrastructure our Parks our playgrounds our coastlines to fortify and protect our city from the worsening climate crisis we are already behind the ball and so we cannot afford any delay in implementing resiliency projects that are crucial to our being able to withstand the worst effect effects of the climate crisis here too our parks are on the front lines when it comes to this work thank you to everyone who has joined today for members of the administration for your testimony and for members of the public and Advocates who are testifying to and for your participation in this hearing I'd like to recognize our colleagues who are here today as part of this committee council member Holden council member Lee council member Marte council member Menan council member wrestler council member Ang council member Carr and council member Brooks Powers thank you and I'll turn it over to our committee councel to swear in today's witnesses can you please raise your right hand do you swear or affirm to tell the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth today you may begin all right um good afternoon um and thank you chair Jano chair chrishan members of the uh Environmental Protection and Parks and Recreation committees my name is RIT agerwal which I'm Chief climate officer of New York City and uh commissioner of the Department of Environmental Protection uh and I am joined today by Elijah Hutchinson our new executive director of the mayor's office of climate environmental justice and Meritt Larson assistant Commissioner of natural resources and planning at the department of parks thank you for the opportunity to speak today on New York City's climate resilience efforts as chair Christian just said climate change is here um we have all witnessed its impact as recently as two weeks ago with tropical storm ofilia since day one the Adams Administration has been focused on better preparing the city for the impacts of climate change including creating my role uh as part of my role I oversee MJ which leads the city's efforts to ensure New York City is reducing its emissions while also protecting New Yorkers from the intensifying impacts of climate change with a focus on equity and public health MJ Works to make buildings efficient and resilient ensure infrastructure his climate ready transform streets in the public realm into living open spaces and make energy clean and resilient and I'm particularly excited about the addition of director executive director Hutchinson to the office he previously LED Coastal res millions in Greenway initiatives as vice president for waterfronts at the New York City Economic Development Corporation his work and ideas will be Central to this City's climate policy including resilience and I am pleased to have him as my colleague um I will depart from the text here uh because in putting together what we thought was a reasonably comprehensive but still high level summary of all we're doing it came to 5,000 words and rather than read all of it to you I leave it to you to read I will give you a couple of high points and then uh conclude but I do want you to know we're doing a lot um a lot of it is shaped and and chair chrisan you know alluded to this I think relatively few New Yorkers appreciate that in 2020 the National Climate assessment recategorized New York City from a continental weather Zone to the subtropical climate zone right so literally our climate has changed this is not something that's coming down the pike it is in fact already happened and that is not coincidentally why about the same time we started to see a significant change in flooding um but there is a lot that we are doing to play catchup as as I think the chairman as both chairman mentioned um we are working uh on Coastal resilience as part of plan YC uh in addition addition to continuing the work that was undertaken in the last two administrations in the aftermath of hurricane uh Sandy and continuing to work very closely with the US Army Corps of Engineers on the Harbor and tributary study we have actually recognized that it is time to create a permanent home within city government for the multi- deade work that it will take to create Coastal resilience for New York City we decided that D is the correct home for that and so actually I'm I'm pleased to say that very soon we will begin the process of standing up a new Bureau of coastal resilience I think there is likely to be a need and and chair janaro and I have discussed the fact that at some point we we will probably seek out uh your Collective assistance in legislating that um as part of the agency's formal uh role but it is uh something that we are not waiting to get started on um starting last year uh we also at D began to undertake a broad look at what it will require in fact to bring the city's storm Water Management Systems up to handle this new reality that we face um there was some very good work done in the immediate aftermath of hurricane Ida by the deasio administration we have Incorporated virtually everything from that into the plans that we are now working on through planyc and others in fact uh we recently did a a tally and um basic Bally 95% of what was in The New Normal report is either completed or in progress or it has been replaced by something that is in uh plan YC that accomplishes the same goal so there was not something that we walked away from it is an evolutionary process that frankly expands as we get smarter about the task last year uh my agency with with the mayor released two programs um one explicitly about short-term flood response we called it rainfall ready I'm pleased we've worked with with a number of you all uh to use your offices to help do things like distribute flood barriers and make residents aware of their flood risk part of rainfall ready was actually publishing flood maps that show precisely by burrow block and lot level the flood risk that each address in New York City faces um that allowed us for example to Target the, 1600 most flood prone residential address to which we proactively reached out uh to offer them flood barriers and information about flood insurance and things like that um however the reality is that changing infrastructure whether it's green infrastructure on the surface or gray infrastructure underground is both very expensive and very longterm um I'm naturally impatient and my staff knows that I keep asking why is this a multi-year planning process and as I have come to appreciate what goes into it I have come to appreciate just how difficult it is to change something as powerful as water in a place as crowded and complex and expensive to do work in as New York city so one of our sad realities is as I have said many times the climate is changing faster than our infrastructure can keep up and among the things we need to do and I'll come back to this is figure out how we as a city can in fact make our processes faster and more capacious so we can do more things at once even if we can't do all things faster um among the things that we have done and and again there's a lot of detail in the written testimonies we've made in the written testimony we've made significant progress and continueed to on Blue belts we have great Ambitions for the blue belt program well Beyond Staten Island even though it's a Staten Island native of course um we are working on cloudburst and we are in fact ahead of schedule with more cloudburst projects that uh we are working on than we're committed to in The New Normal report at the end of 2021 so we're very pleased by those um as I think many of you know back last year D implemented the unified storm water rule which requires large properties when they are uh constructed upon or or when significant changes happen on a given parcel that they have to begin to manage storm water on site any storm water managed on site prevents it from flowing into over taxed sewers during a heavy rainstorm and therefore that directly prevents flooding in addition in most parts of the city that kind of work also reduces combined sewer overflows which can uh contributes to the Clean Harbor that we all know and care about um we've made significant progress over the last two years with the flood net sensor program which um I was certainly looking at all day day long on on September 29th and I would imagine some of you uh may have been it as well it is far from complete and and among the things we have been doing uh consistently I will not say actually in response to that storm because we were doing it well before that is trying to figure out how we can change that program in its details or augment it so that it can be built out more quickly we are currently in year two of a five-year build um but that is making a lot of uh Headway already and actually I think it was quite useful on September 29th to be able to see what what was going on um as I think uh chair Krishan alluded to um the mayor's office of climate environmental justice has already kicked off the early planning work around climate strong communities which is our neighborhood level effort at engaging with communities to do multi-hazard planning um and we are working on a voluntary buyout program um which is another one of these things like the Bureau of coastal resilience where it takes a while to figure out the institutional issues um it's not just about having the money although buyouts in New York City are going to be breathtakingly expensive but it is also about how you do the institution so that legally we can conduct transactions that are frankly very unlike the transactions that the city's land acquisition policies and practices are designed uh for you you know just think about the question of how you pay fair market value for a property that has been destroyed legally we have to pay only fair market value right so there's a lot of institutional work that we have to put in place right now and MJ in conjunction with several other agencies is leading that planning work and we're optimistic uh about where that will go um one final thing before I move on uh is heat and I think you both uh both Sher janiro and Cher Krishan mentioned the fact that flooding is not our only risk that as part of being a subtropical City we now have a significant Heat program and as I have said on on many occasions we are keenly aware of the fact that despite the terrible losses we suffered during Hurricane Ida and Hurricane Sandy heat over the last decade is still the way climate change has killed most New Yorkers right that we think more than 350 New Yorkers have died as an excess number over previous patterns due to the higher uh heat levels that we've experienced in some during the summer over the last decade um it's one of the reasons that that this Administration has committed to work towards and this is actually going to be extraordinarily difficult to figure out but to work towards a maximum indoor temperature the reality is the vast majority of bedrooms in New York City have air conditioning those who don't live in affordable housing those who don't live in Nicha those who don't live in places where the economics of it are not going to be easy to figure out um but it is something that we are committed to and I will also make the point that we cannot stop thinking about mitigation that we have to make sure that we work to reduce our carbon emissions because the first thing you do when you find yourself in a hole is stop digging and we've got to help make this problem not get any worse than it already is and that's a the reasons that I'm very proud of The Proposal that this Administration has put out for how to implement local law 97 we think it is thoughtful we think it is actually very aggressive we also think it is correctly designed to work with and and take into account the needs of building owners and among the things that I hope we can have help with from members of the city council is uring that as the state Public Service Commission defines the way it will use the next five billion dollar of systems benefit charge money that is going to be raised from the electric bills of New Yorkers and programmed that they use it in a way that directly helps buildings comply with local law 97 which is I think one of the most important opportunities we have and one that I am desperately worried we will let slip away if the state and Con Edison do not choose to work with us in a collaborative way another area where we could use your help and I I know chairman Janeiro you've been tremendously helpful in this respect already and and uh chair Christan you uh alluded to this um is around New York City getting its fair share of federal and state money the reality is we do not we do not get our fair share of federal and state money um because in fact a large portion of the bipartisan infrastructure law funding is put through the state and unfortunately New York state has decided to apply rules to how it disperses that money particularly with respect to D infrastructure that could contribute towards the overall effort for storm water resilience that that categorically excludes municipalities of more than 300,000 people from applying for those Grant funds we think that decision purely an administrative decision it's neither regulation nor it is law is going to cost New York City a billion dollars in federal funding that it would otherwise be eligible for and I know the committee has put forward some questions about the environmental Bond act $4.2 billion uh for environmental uh efforts including for example a qu billion dollar uh dedicated for voluntary buyouts um the state has not put out guidelines for the vast majority of that money yet we do not know whether it will be equitably distributed um but I do know that New York City is roughly 60% of the tax space and so New York City residents will pay 60% of that $4.2 billion and we have to make very clear to Albany that we should be able to get our fair share I will return now to the last two pages of my written testimony but all of the things I've I've covered are in there and and by the way actually I will also say to intro 1069 of course we're very concerned about uh water quality whether it's in the harbor which my agency pays very close attention to or in in other water bodies we have a very extensive testing program across multiple agencies right now that is primarily driven by the state um both Department of Health and the department of uh environmental um conservation and uh we certainly share the Bill's intention to be able to know what is going on in our water and assure New Yorkers that it is safe we would look forward to working with the committee uh to ensure that this bill does not add unnecessary cost without uh creating value or wind up working at Cross purposes to the practices that we have uh already overseen by our state Regulators so we're very happy to work with you on that um I'll conclude with a couple of points here um major physical projects and I'll I'll go back to the written text uh major physical projects take a significant amount of time typically one to three years for planning and design one to two years for procurement and from one to four years of construction to reduce this time would require changes to several processes such as environmental review ulurp when Acquisitions are required and procurement rules D has invested significantly in improving our procurement with great success we have reduced a nearly two-year procurement cycle a year and a half ago down to just one year just one year um further we have improved internal processes to increase our commitment rate for capital projects one one of my big disappointments of fiscal year 22 was that we achieved only a 69% commitment rate for the year which meant that in that fiscal year DP left nearly half a billion dollars in capital on the table unspent through a significant whole of agency effort we are proud to report that for the first time in a decade D achieved our Capital commitment Target in fiscal year 23 reaching 103% of our $2.3 billion Capital plan uh in fact we committed $2.4 billion in new capital projects a year-on-year increase of $800 million in new projects breaking ground for construction or starting into design uh We've also contributed to the capital process reform task force convened by mayor Adams and controller Lander last year the task force released a set of recommendations including using price adjustment allowance to offset volatile commodity commodity markets expanding work allowances to reduce change order approvals and amending procurement laws and regulations also significantly the task force has made recommendations for the city to adopt alternative project delivery mechanisms such as Progressive design build and has proposed that the DDC become an authority we strongly support these recommendations as these efforts will speed up capital projects reduce costs and increase the city's capacity to address emerging needs um and I will just say I think those are some of the things as as we look to do this work we need help in clearing the obstacles to getting work done uh you know projects face the same delays it doesn't matter whether it's a resilience project a water main project whatever it is you all face the same sort of delays anything we can do to speed up our ability to deliver capital projects is going to make the city more resilient and anything we do that slows that down is going to hinder our ability to achieve resilience um there aren't a lot of easy ways to speed up an individual project but we also face constraints on how many we can take on at once this is basically a function of D's planning and Engineering capacity and ddc's engineering and Contracting capacity I would welcome any help the city council can offer in figuring out how to increase DS and D ddc's capacity to deliver projects or how the city's design procurement and construction timetables can be speeded up climate is generational and because of that there are tradeoffs for example we must balance water rate affordability with our resilience considerations storm water projects are breathtakingly expensive starting last year DP has been working on a set of example projects to understand by extrapolation what it would take to create true storm water resilience across the city we expect to have a bit to say on that later this year and much more to say on that next spring in 2021 my predecessor estimated it would require a cost of $100 billion which would require water rates to go up by about 500% 500% increase in water rates to pay for something like that depending on the level of storm water resilience we want we may have to brace for dramatic increases in water bills and this is not theoretical as we at D Begin work towards our fiscal year 25 Capital plan it would be helpful to know what council members think about how much to invest given that all of our investments in storm water resilience are passed along in the water bill unless we can get state or federal money we must also consider the importance of affordable housing to resilience work three key strategies for resilience requiring air conditioners protecting people who live in basement apartments and the voluntary Mobility Program to remove people who live in atrisk properties are likely to directly reduce the city's affordable housing Supply we cannot have both affordable housing and resilience unless we dramatically increase the creation of new housing across the city and we need to recognize that some homes are impossible to protect from flooding MJ has been collaborating closely with the Department of city planning on city of yes Zoning for Housing Opportunity which was kicked off in September which includes uh dealing with the issues of basement apartments and flood risk and the considerations of climate hazards when ciding and building new housing we have worked closely with our colleagues at the parks department working to explore opportunities for blue belts for storm water resilience and Coastal protection on the large portion of the city's Waterfront that is Parkland but the reality is that there will be times where Parks uses and resilience uses are at odds or at very least cause delay and increase cost right now the protection afforded to Parkland ensures Parks objectives will take precedence but that is a reality that we have to acknowledge I would welcome the council's advice on how to balance these trade-offs some of these are political more than technical so they're very appropriate for elected to aine on all New Yorkers especially those who own their own homes also must take responsibility for protecting themselves in their property as I've have said many times for 400 years New Yorkers have enjoyed a relatively mild climate but this is no longer the case the city can and should and will do as much as it can but tropical rainstorms are difficult to predict and New Yorkers will need to protect themselves anyone who owns a home needs to have flood Insurance homeowners should disconnect their downspouts from their roofs so they do not connect to the sewer line which C often causes sewer backups inside the the home even when the city's sewer is not at capacity and homeowners need to stop and reverse the paving over of permeable surfaces which is increased the proportion of storm water that runs into our sewers uh during the strongest rains I know many of you have worked closely with us to raise awareness through events such as rain barrel giveaways and I very much appreciate those efforts and I would welcome more ways the city council could help us encourage New Yorkers to do their part there is of course a lot more in this uh long testimony um I have a number of colleagues in addition to the two who are here at the table to answer your questions I very much appreciate uh these two committees coming together to tackle uh this really difficult ult but utterly important issue and I look forward to taking your questions thank you thank you commissioner I I think on behalf of all of us we thank you for your comprehensive testimony and for all the reading material that you provided for us um 5,000 words is um a lot and um we appreciate the uh uh you know comprehensive nature of your um testimony uh I'm going to be very brief we have it's always my habit or my practice to um uh we have members here that want to participate in a um significant way so I'll be very brief in order to open the door for all the members with their great ideas um to pose questions um um my committee is now um we've been joining by council member Basquez very happy to uh have her here um I just made some notes as you were going through your statement and I'll just U ask a little bit about that um uh with regard to all that the uh Administration is doing with regard to storm water um I made notes on the front of your we got the rainfall ready Cloud burst technology the blue belts uh um uh unified storm water rule the flood flood net sensor program uh you know we had spoken a while ago you know you and I CU you know I had Vision because way back I don't know 2007 whatever it is um the council did uh you know the first you know comprehensive Stone Water Management plan that was really more for um you know csos then then it was for Street flooding and uh and that accomplished uh you know you we can go on and on about all the good things that that did accomplish and so now we're at um St Water Management 2.0 so to speak where we're really concerned about about Street flooding and um and you know I was going to hold back on my bill because there was so much you know coming out of DP and um Moc EJ that was going to be crystallized uh into um uh into a you know Grand storm water management plan um and you know you made reference to the fact that there'll be something big coming out I imagine that what that is is everything all wrapped up in a bow in terms of this is what we want to do regarding Stone W management going forward and then my plan was then to and that would be a great policy document but then I thought it would be great to uh crystallize that into law which is what we did with stone owners plan does that still seem like a good Paradigm to you um so I think certainly at at some point the idea of of legislating a plan uh may make sense I would ask if you don't mind that we wait until this first piece of work comes out yeah I've been I've been waiting I I will say and I just to manage expectations it is not going to be everything we want all wrapped up in a bow it is the first step towards that uh I'm thinking about it a bit as kind of a an options paper so we can begin collectively as a city to wrap our brains around what this might actually take um because there are a number of big big changes that you could imagine needing and and certainly big projects even if they don't wind up visually being uh challenging yeah I I I I just think it's um I I I I think it's a noble and one that has worked for you and me and for the council in the city going way back to the first planyc when we took some of the good initiatives that and we crystallized them into law and then you know that is I I I I think served the city well so um you know let me just say that you know I and I think on bef of the counil We Stand ready as a partner for you um to do what seems to make sense in terms of what elements of that new plan should be you know reduced to legislation um so that would you know carry forward and I think that uh you know our institution should bear um you know some of the burden of you know doing what we need to do in concert with the administration um to let people know how serious this is and how much it's going to cost and um so you know we have those this is really an offer to burden share is really what it is and so um we certainly appreciate that and um one thing that and again with all of the you know with all of the um uh focus on flooding from all of the storms um of course this is a hearing on resiliency and I know we have the Hat study and all that that's talking about all bunch of different things but what I'm not um what I'm somewhat afraid of having get lost in the all the flooding that we're talking about um is a storm surge and um you know this certainly still you know was is and will be the um you know the you know the most threatening clear and present danger although with the street flooding of late I I think you know I think storm surge has kind of like a run for its money with um everything that we're doing and and all the flooding that we're having and um um and I I I have you know long been a fan of you know storm surge barriers whatever people have different ideas about that but if you could just tell us where we are with regard to um uh you know getting out in front of and planning for storm surge um I I just that has to be part of the equation that has part of the conversation um thank you yes and and certainly and and so uh there's a a couple of things there first of all there are a number of projects sorry if I if I don't site my list I'm going to miss a couple um but there are a number of actually you've got it yeah so I'll ask Elijah to uh to talk to some of the projects that are going on but but quickly we've got a set of projects right now that the city is driving um in conjunction in many cases or or certainly in coordination with the Army Corps but where the city is actually leading the work as it is with easts side Coastal resilience which is certainly underway as as you all know and actually closer to completion then to uh to initiation um part of the reason to create a bureau of coastal resilience is that we accept expect the city's portfolio of projects like that only to grow um and uh we've had some very um promising conversations with the Army Corps about uh uh new models of project delivery that they are empowered to explore that might allow us to do even more of that in conjunction with the Army Corps specifically with respect to the Hat study um the Army Corps has not yet uh released its decision on the you know they they had put out the in the recommended the the recommended alternative which is primarily around landside barriers with uh a number of uh title barriers at uh specific water bodies like Jamaica Bay flushing Bay Kil van Call Etc um I believe they received something like 6,000 comments far more than they had ever done for any project um and I think to their credit the Army Corps has been very communicative with us um and with the the two states that are its Partners um I don't have anything to say on on where that process is heading right now I believe the Army Corps may be here they can they can speak for themselves but I have to say I I think it's going well the sad reality is those are some of the most long-term projects you can imagine right right that is that is the work of decades and not years um which is why again it it become so important for us to think about the things we can do that complement that in the near term but Elijah maybe you could talk about the status some of the specific projects we've got um just adding to also greetings to your first uh uh first appearance for the committee and um we all congratulate you on your new position and wish you well thank you so much it's a it's an honor to be here and as a native New Yorker and someone who's been in government for over a decade uh that's where the fun stops by the way now you're now you're like going to get it we um building off what is saying with our collaboration with the Army Corps they're in a process of um understanding and and responding to all of the feedback they they received from the city but I wanted to focus that our feedback was about making sure that their approach covers multiple hazards and multiple climate risks that they focus on environmental justice communities that they prioritize Community engagement and Outreach as they move forward in their process and that they expedite project delivery as much as possible so that we can see results from their process and work with them to deliver these projects as soon as we can um so there's a ton of collaboration happening with the core as well as with other City agencies on our Coastal resilience portfolio of projects there are some that we're more familiar with like easts side Coastal resilience um there are others that are under construction like the battery Coastal resilience project um Brooklyn Bridge Montgomery Coastal resilience projects which um there are shovels in the ground uh there are also groundbreakings that happened recently at Battery Park City um and then there's other Coastal resilience projects and plans happening in Coney Island and Red Hook and other neighborhoods with where we're raising the shorelines and Street ends to have more protection from those Coastal Storm surges um and then we also have the climate strong communities process which is um the pro the process by which we are developing the a pipeline of of projects uh building off the neighborhoods that were impacted um during Sandy but really thinking about what's next and I know that there were questions about um you know the prioritization of the uh of the projects that are there and what our selection criteria were for for that work um and we are focused on the communities that um are identified as environmental justice communities we're focused on areas that are going to be receiving multiple hazards and multiple climate threats and we're also looking at the areas where it's really going to be possible for a city-led adaptation project to make a difference within that neighborhood um so we're excited to work with you thank you uh thank you very much I have many more questions but um I'm going to be here all day I'm very uh eager to hear from my esteemed uh co-chair and all the members of my committee and uh his committee uh who are here so I'm going to cut off my questioning for now uh um recognize my u u great co-chair um and and uh hear from other members who have a lot of value added but I will just make a note to uh uh staff of my committee that um I would like U uh to um make arrangement for a briefing um with um Elijah to find out you everything that's really going on regarding storm surge that's what kind of keeps me up at night and so um if that's a note to staff if we could get that arranged that would be great okay certainly and with that I uh recog I myam co-chair thank you so you got thank you so much chair Jano uh and thank you for your questions too um before uh I get started with my questions uh I did want to recognize that um from we've been joined by a special guest someone who I met with earlier um mayor nages COA from B nagar Nepal uh who's here we met earlier today in my office uh B mayor KLA is uh the son of the Koda family which was instrumental in bringing democracy to Nepal and uh one of the reasons why he's here for this hearing is because one of his priorities um in be nagar Nepal is to focus on building a wastewater treatment plant uh because in Nepal they're also addressing the serious issue of their streets flooding because of the monsoons so thank you so much mayor COA for joining us it's an honor to have you here and as uh the mayor and I have talked about um and uh uh as we all know the climate crisis is an international crisis um affecting all of our countries in different ways and so I look forward to ways that we can collaborate both here in a city and globally all of us as Citizens to address this issue uh of the climate crisis facing our world um and I just want to make a note to my staff that next time we have a hearing we got to bring somebody too set the bar high on this one we had International here uh but um but well thank you so much to our our panel of uh uh commissioner assistant Commissioners uh who are here today it's uh we appreciate your testimony very much and the work that you're doing in our city when it comes to resilience work um and uh we appreciate also that the testimony commissioner agella is so long because or you had a 5,000-word testimony set to go because of all the work that you all are doing and that's the kind of think we'd like to hear given the magnitude of what we're facing um I just have a few questions myself before turning over to colleagues um I did want to focus assistant commissioner on our parks and how our parks are a critical piece of our uh climate uh resiliency work as well so just you know uh before focusing other areas I did mention in my opening statement the importance of our tree canopy um as part of our uh the fight against climate change too and so one question I had was given the legislation we've passed given the goal that I believe is critical of getting to a 30% tree canopy cover by 2035 um how has Parks approached and thought about um addressing and increasing tree plantings in our tree canopy particularly in areas um that desperately need it um and lack it thank you for the question I um definitely appreciate and Parks greatly appreciates the support and uh emphasis on protecting the city's tree canopy and uh it's obviously a major uh focus of our agency um with respect to uh some of the um questions that we've um received both in advance of the um of the hearing and and in the context of um the in the context of um some of the bills that are proposed uh just wanted to reiterate that our tree planting efforts continue to prioritize areas defined as uh highly heat vulnerable by the department of Health's you know heat vulnerability index and the factors that go into the development of this index so that continues to be the focus area um I'm not going to speak in detail to the our tree planting um priorities and and uh the the testimony that's probably been given to the in the last hearing um that's not my area of expertise and I'm glad to take back any specific questions to um our colleagues um my counterparts in the forestry division in particular uh but U that the roll out of our tree planting efforts both in the RightWay and in our natural areas continues to be you know a main focus um as you um may have heard we've been very successful um not as successful as we wanted to be but pretty successful in getting um uh Federal funding through the IRA for our tree planting efforts uh in particular in natural areas we received you know 10 million dollar through the uh program of urban community forestry just um just announced last month and in addition um we received $5 million uh to focus on Urban Tree can uh Urban Tree Care uh and stewardship and planting in um again in some of our priority environmental justice areas so that uh continues to be our focus and we're looking at creative ways to bring more um more Federal funding into that effort absolutely and I've very much appreciated um parks's efforts in that regard too and and the work that we've done together um with Majority Leader Schumer as well to make sure that it's communities um that particularly lack tree canopy coverage that are prioritized when it comes to Ira funding that our city has received so thank you for for parks's leadership on on that front um going to the Federal grant programs in particular because I think you know one of the biggest things that we keep coming back to is we need more Investments um in in um our communities um in um this area in particular too and so one thing I wanted to ask was how will the city ensure that it gets its fair share of funding from the New York New York State Environmental Bond act thank you for the question and um highlighting the importance of the bond act which we're very much uh aware of and have been eagerly awaiting information about for the last uh many years we are U taking the the way in which we're preparing for the opportunity to apply is to be meeting with our state um de with our state counterparts that can give us any insight into the focus of the um of the opportunities uh in particular in the last month we submitted uh probably about 15 of potential projects through their survey opportunity so that we could get feedback on what kinds of uh projects they might be receptive to funding um we also have focused very much on identifying some of the constraints that might hinder us from being successful in those applications some of which uh might relate to the time frame in which they would expect implementation um we've heard today about some of our challenges in procurement um and our overall Capital design schedules and we want to be competitive um with Upstate in any Capital programs for example we would apply for so it's very much on our mind um looking at what successful projects could be and if uh you all aren't able to receive that funding for whatever reason or there's other you know we don't get more through the IRA for example what are the contingency plans in place for the city um to still access funds that would be needed um for these resiliency programs thank you for the question uh that's focusing on funding obviously very critical we in in some ways um our mindset is always uh to be uh maybe Scrappy and um really pursue all the opportunities uh that we can uh we're continuing uh through to explore grant opportunities specifically through the mayor's uh the deputy mayor's um Grant's task force uh that's been a way in which um we are sharing information across you know City agencies uh about opportunities um we're U continuing to pursue grants uh grant opportunities uh from federal agencies like uh Noah National Oceanic um and Atmospheric Administration we've done that for years and continue to do so as well as pursue opportunities uh from the US Environmental Protection Agency they've funded many of our uh projects that have contributed to us understanding the conditions in particular for our Wetlands over the last 10 years uh We've um are continuing to look at other state programs that have uh always well for for decades really funded uh projects um both capital projects and um stewardship and job training projects so uh we can provide you just to give you a um more thorough understanding of U what we've accomplished in the last 10 years what that those lists of Grants are and what we have coming down the pike but we are continue to actively pursue that and have at at any given time you know more than a dozen projects that are Grant funded and more than a dozen that are that we're pursuing on that scale commissioner um just just to clarify were you focused on resilience projects and Parks or more more G uh I parks in particular with my question but also if you if you do have um you any comments on uh resiliency projects in general too very happy to hear about I'll just reiterate that um you know when we don't get Federal money either we have to take money out of C City uh City uh tax levy um for things like Coastal resilience currently um or for storm water projects we have to raise the water rate got it thank you um now going back to uh to Parks a bit uh you know one of the things that I'm I just have a few more questions and I'm going to turn it over to my colleagues one was uh you know on September 29th when this when the storm uh happened and you know I one thing that really struck me both in walking my kids to school and seeing the into flooding that morning and then over the course of the day uh was I maintain that our parks and tree canopy have such an essential role to play um in absorbing storm water um in incorporating green infrastructure um to to assist with the issue of major flooding that we've seen um with this storm uh with Ida before um you know my district in particular Queens Boulevard places like that that were extraordinarily flooded could really benefit um from from more creative infrastructure from Parks and otherwise um to uh to address the flooding that we see in the rain so I'm just curious since this is our first time talking since um that that storm how has Parks thought about um not so much it its response yes but also proactively looking into the future perspectively what thoughts have you all had about how Parks could play a role in addressing this issue and protecting us from the next climate emergency um what was your thinking before how has it changed um what other measures do you see as um critical that could be implemented now when the next storm comes which it will thank you for the question uh we are in some ways always looking at um storm water response uh throughout our Parks system and both incorporating green and gray um infrastructure so I'll go back to um just focusing on for a minute the kinds of formal green infrastructure that um collaboration that we've had uh with D um and then just mention some of our other um approaches so we've worked with d on expanding green infrastructure um in for storm water capture since 2011 and we've are continuing to sort of bolster that program both through retrofits uh in our parks to capture both the impervious area within um our Park property as well as um in previous area on the street uh through a number of programs um retrofitting um Parks adding green infrastructure components into n Park projects and um i' pursuing grants to expand uh more our ability to do more creative green infrastructure projects um we've got for example a um a number of projects in Staten Island uh that wouldn't have otherwise come under uh other funding programs so that we can expand our own ability within um our design and construction teams to implement uh projects that capture storm water in our from our own assets as well as from the streets so that continues um to be a big Focus we've got um dozen moving towards you know hundreds of uh projects that are in design and that will come online over the next several years so with that um roll out of programs we are always increasing our um capacity and ability to uh be creative to to speak to that um component and um I think you'll see in the testimony that there are a number of um project uh types of programs that we're of course partnering on with d whether it's uh cloudburst programs that happen in Parks or or blue belt programs um that in in um to speak to some of our other elements of um you know attention to having resilient Parks I mean that's uh part of the reason we pay such close attention to the type of uh tree planting we do How We Do It um and doing it right whether both on the street um or in the natural areas and increasingly with you know over the last 10 years um an understanding of the climate change um and the the likelihood of having more resilient plant um species uh coming from the south we're actually looking very carefully at our plant pallet and so that's an ongoing uh effort it's not uh it's not you know something that we're suddenly thinking about you know since last week or even since Ida and then um lastly I'll just say that uh it's uh particularly important um that that we understand the critical aspect of Maintenance whether it's maintaining you know the vegetation um maintaining rain Gardens um ability to clean out catch basins after a storm but um it it goes back to being able to do and have the resources to do the work on the ground to make sure these green infrastructure systems are ready for the next storm thank you and I just urge you all to really um to to to to keep that uh planning going because uh you know it's it's there's far more we have to to do on that front to think of our Parks you know as um fortifications against climate change so I'm heartened to hear the efforts and encourage them to keep going uh my final question is you know and and really for for both um parks and D is we're talking about all these issues that are so crucial uh measures that need to be implemented um requiring funding from all different levels of government um and we couldn't agree more with that at the same time we're looking at an Administration that's proposing drastic pegs um um that will cut from the very types of work and services uh including these that we need to fortify our city so uh my question for you all is how will the recently announced hiring frees um the pre proposals um phased in three times over the next year um by the mayor disrupt the city's climate resiliency projects well so let me start by saying uh at least in so far as far as D is concerned the water utility portion of D's budget which is a little more than 90% of our budget and includes all of the storm water and sewer work is not subject to the peg we are subject to the otps free and we are subject to the hiring freeze but we're not uh subject to the Peg and of course we are doing everything we possibly can to uh ensure that none of our services are hurt or slowed down uh by that but we are working through the the two freezes that we are subject to thank you commissioner and I just add that it's it's there there's a disconnect there between um the work that you all need to be doing and are doing and getting the appropriate funding from our own city government to do so if we expect the federal government and the states to step in then our city needs to be the first mover to act and put that funding in um especially when it comes to resiliency projects um for Parks you know I'd asked the same question of you as well assistant commissioner and with really a focus on for Parks you mentioned maintenance and how important that is too so how would these pegs how are you all thinking about these pegs how will they affect maintenance and operations um especially for Parks um that are smaller and don't have the private Conservancy resources that depend on city funding well I'm actually not prepared to answer that and I think as an agency I don't think we're quite ready yet either um we'll be working with om and um working with our budget office to identify how to best respond so we're we're committed to maintaining The Parks at a at a standard that um we've always held and I'll continue to do so but um we won't have any specific response uh until the November plan comes out and that at that time sure thank you and I would just add again uh we're we're in a conversation about cutting from Parks and green spaces that are crucial for our health crucial for our climate the conversation should really be about how to increase resources for our parks department and so to see pegs being proposed by this Administration that will give you all fewer resources to maintain our green spaces fewer resources to make our Parks more resilient in the face of a worsening climate crisis worsening floods uh is shocking um and doesn't comport with what the work that we know needs to be done uh to actually invest in our Park system uh on that note I'll turn it over now for questions from our colleagues uh the first one is uh council member Brooks Powers thank you chairs and thank you um commissioner for your remarks as you know in my district last week we saw a flooding due to mesh that was left on top of catch basins on construction corridors but that mesh was unfortunately not removed prior to the flooding at these locations how is DP addressing this issue in advance of future floodings also how frequently does d Clean Catch basins can you walk through what the protocols are in place to ensure catch basins receive the necessary maintenance and cleaning and finally in 2018 the mayor made a commitment of $2 billion towards improving sewer infrastructure in southeast Queen neighborhoods can you provide an update on the progress of that project and is there any plans on Expediting those that particular project because we see these now frequent weather events happening where not only the places that have um been queued up for or that have historically received flooding we're seeing new parts of queens that are receiving flooding as well and I know I said that was last but the last last is in the arbor Community along Beach 67 Street D came in and thankfully put infrastructure in that was supposed to suck up the water um from these weather events and to help prevent the flooding unfortunately the way it was built the pitch has created a dynamic where along thursby Bas in um excuse me thursby and Beach 67th there has been an uh a lot of flooding going into the homes we saw that in winter storm Elliot in December we saw that again last week with the rainwater it doesn't even really take those weather events if we have high tide if there's um light rain we are still seeing it so can DP come back revisit that site and do the necessary work to address that project that took place that now is impacting over a dozen homes along that strip um thank you council member I'll I'll U try to tackle these in reverse order regarding the specific project in arvor uh of course we'll have somebody come take a look I um I not going to commit we can fix it until we know what we think is going on but we will certainly work with your office well the challenge is some of those homes even before didn't get the level of flooding they've gotten now and the contract is that did it had acknowledged to some of the homeowners that it was not when they look back after the fact that it's not pitched correctly huh okay well we will as I said we'll we'll um we'll look into that particular site um in terms of Southeast Queens the work is proceeding uh I think as as I was saying in in my statement we are thinking broadly about how we can expand and accelerate storm water management work across the city so we don't have any specific plans right now to accelerate the work specifically going in on in southeast Queens but that is in the budget it is in the budget for all of the next 10 years so that work is slated to continue on I'm sorry to that point what will the city be doing in the meantime because we have homeowners that are being flooded we have people who live in the basement in those areas we have high water tables literally one of my home one of my residents in my district w woke up by standing up off her bed to get ready for work only to find that her feet was covered with water so as they wait for this construction project to take place what is the city doing to make sure that we are mitigating the flooding that's taking place well council member look as I as I said uh the reality is these are long-term projects right there is no matter no no no amount of Desire on our part could accelerate uh all of those projects at once um it's one of the reasons that we started last year only a couple of months after this Administration took office rainfall ready which is really as as I have characterized it it's the Band-Aid um you know a Band-Aid is what you put on a wound while nature slowly heals the wound but you protect it from getting worse right and so what that includes for example is uh the the distribution of flood barriers which are not a unique technology you can buy them at Home Depot we give them out uh you know in part to help people in part to make sure people know that that that technology exists so people who have particular uh flooding issues through their driveway through a front door you basically it's it's like a sandbag that's easier to store because you can empty the water out and and refill it and Advance the flood and we thank you for it you did give that to my district as well as some pumps and we are appreciative of that uh the the sum pumps that we've started uh Distributing in in certain circumstances uh we have um flood alarms so just like you have a smoke alarm uh we uh would encourage anybody who lives in a basement apartment you can get a uh flood sensor so that uh your constituent would have wouldn't have woken up with the surprise she would have heard the alarm to let her know when flooding is starting um pursuant to uh a local law my agency is working now on a a study around Backwater uh preventors um so that is I I will have more to say in a couple of months on that score certainly before the end of the year um so there are a number of things and finally of course it's about um getting flood insurance which I know is a financial challenge to some um but nonetheless it is just a reality uh that the city is not going to be able to protect everybody in the near- term we are working as hard as we can to develop a comprehensive approach but it will take time there is no no way around it um you ask about catch facing one point on that there are some homeowners or residents that have flood insurance and were told by their insurance carrier that they would not be covering it well that I that is something that I think perhaps we should have a a follow-on conversation about we have heard of of complaints like that and uh of course it is the state that deals with um enfor foring good behavior among insurance companies but I think that's something I'd be happy to talk with you and your staff about thank you um you asked about catch Bas and cleaning so uh at the beginning of last fiscal year so last summer um D implemented something I think is is really very good which is a um a risk based approach to catch Basin inspections and cleanings so rather than treating all 160,000 of our catch Basin as equally likely to get clogged or equally impact ful if they do get clogged we actually developed a risk assessment so some uh catch basins that are on high traffic streets or near a subway station or something so we think they might be likely to get clogged very quickly or they would be really impactful if they flood they are actually getting uh checked every six months others that are uh for location reasons or others less likely to get clogged or less impactful if they do are on a three-year cycle that's a way that we optimize the impact of the labor hours that it takes physically to go around and check these um in advance of a storm so whenever the flash flood program is activated there are about 2,000 high priority catch basins that are allocated among D do and sanitation and so when the flash flood uh flash flood program is activated by the office of emergency management as it was on Thursday morning the 28th actually pretty early I think 8 AM um Crews go out and check those high priority locations and to the extent that it's possible we will go and clean them if they are clogged one of the things that I think we we are always eager to remind people of is there is a difference between clogging and covering right so if a catch Basin fills up with material the top has to be opened up it has to get scooped out that requires a special truck only D can do that um what often happens especially in the middle of a storm and I know of several places in the city where this happened on the 29th that when the rain started sanitation Sweet Street s sweepers had done their job the catch basins were were fine all of that water especially during the during the Autumn brings leaves covers over mats over the catch basins and then you start getting flooding of course when we find out about that we do dispatch crews in the middle of a storm as long as it's safe and immediately right after to clear those spaces but I also know of several instances and um maybe even one or two people here who went out um in the middle of the storm identified locations like that all it takes is a rake and I think one opportunity we may have is to think about how we get New Yorkers to to do that kind of work that the reality is there is no way with massive increases in resources that D could respond in real time to 160,000 catch basins around the city so I think there is something around a distributed response and then you mentioned the meshes which you know you and I spoke about um the weekend of the 30th 31 uh you know those construction me meeses and these are this is actually a kind of a lining that basically uh prevents grit from going into the catch basins it's particularly I believe required in in the separately sewered areas of the city including uh your district and it is actually a State DEC requirement for construction so our plan is actually we need to talk to DEC um because one of the things that we think is probably necessary as a requirement on their part that the construction contracts include uh a commitment by the contractor when there is a flash flood warning to remove those meshes it is not something that D installs it's not even something the D mandates it is actually a state item so we will talk to them thank you for that thank you chairs thank you thank you council member we're joined by council member Nar CE uh happy to have her here with us um and I recognize council member nurse for questions um and um we didn't start the clock right away for the last um so yeah there was there was there there was extra time there but you know it's a majority whip thank you chair come on and um we recogniz we we recognize council member nurse for questions thank you chair um first of all congratulations and welcome um I want to um thank you commissioner for just the proactive Communications you've had at least directly with me um with regards to Heavy Rain events in Bushwick um and just just how commun how available and accessible you have been um to hear all of my gripes um and I do appreciate the short-term mitigation efforts that you all have been putting in in the recurring areas that are getting hit um in Bushwick however we're kind you know and I've said this at other hearings we're just at this point where people are demanding answers I'm aware of what you're saying because I'm here at the these hearings um but I think at this point what we're looking for is an as a timeline of when there will even be a proposal for what to do and I don't know it's hard to understand I understand that each one is each neighborhood that has this type of recurring flooding might have specific things that are unique to it but Bushwick needs to know where we are in that pipeline are we neighborhood 20 are we neighborhood three um is it in two years we will get uh a vision of a proposal just anything more concretely would be really helpful because we are the ones getting yelled at we are the ones getting the the brunt of the communications with which and the answers are not easy to communicate um and so we need just a little more transparency in terms of where we are in these projects excuse me um Council council member look it's a it's a very fair question certainly for your specific um issue with the flooding on nicer Bacher that that we've uh that you and I have walked through and uh um we've spent a lot of time there is active work going on right now uh around what the Alternatives could be um so I think we would have more to share with your constituents certainly before the end of the year um I don't know if that includes a firm timetable right um but we will certainly have more to say uh that that will it include um what the all the options are certainly it will include the options that we are exploring okay is there any uh funding dedicated to specifically to addressing the fun flooding in bushwig I think once we figure out exactly what the preferred option is um there there is so so it was alluded to I forget in in uh I think one of the chair's um opening remarks uh two billion dollars that was set aside in The New Normal report that is a pool of money that we could potentially draw from uh we will have to figure out where to pull that funding together from but you know realistically first we have to figure out what we're what we're trying to do I for what it's worth I'll say um in part because of the uh in part because of our our ability to have recourse to the water bill and in part because D has focused so much on our ability to do procurement and deliver capital capital availability is not our main constraint our main constraint is much more around the ability to design uh these projects at once I think you're all at the city council familiar with the challenges that New York City has had in attracting and retaining civil engineers yes which is not just about the city I hear that from every AE consultant out there right but that's one of our key bottlenecks thank you for that um I do think that you know I would really recommend that the city you know engage in uh louder Outreach on communicating that the timelines are far because you know the water barriers are nice if you have a hose um but I'm not seeing them being used actively we've given a lot of way we appreciate um them and it feels like something but it when when it actually is happening in real time it's it's not as effective um so I I think we need to have more robust Communications from the agencies or the administration like hey we don't have answers for you for two to three years and because people need to know that when they're investing in our communities um because it's not just for us it's not just nicker Boger we have public housing we have you know like a 20 you know 10 15 block radius where people are just whole floor is just useless um okay uh I'll move on another question I have is kind of in relation to the resolution um and I've asked about this a little bit before does d formally review uh land use or housing applications involving uh City subsidies that will be constructed within uh uh future high-risk flood [Music] zones I I will need to see whether de P has any role within that process I believe that would be undertaken by City Planning but I would um have to get back to you on that okay thank you chair thank you so much counc nurse uh next up is council member Carr thank you uh chairs janiro and Krishnan for this crucial hearing commissioner and it's good to see you and your colleagues all here um I just want to start by thanking D for its transformational Investments whether it's the form separate sewer infrastructure replacing septic and combined sewer over the last 30 years and of course Landmark blue belt Investments that have been just transformational for my communities even with current challenges um I just have three questions that I want to focus in on um the first is um with respect to the seaw wall project first forecasts were that it was going to start in 2018 and finish in 2021 and obviously that has been a mistake um and I know they're about to take over some blue belt Creations uh from DP near father capano so I'd love to hear your perspective on where things are and what needs to happen for this to move forward um additionally um I know that there is some blue Bel project expansions contemplated for South Beach and Grasmere but not yet in the capital plan I know you talked about that in the round but love to hear more specifics about you know when that might come about and then finally um with respect to the Westerly willbrook clove Lakes drainage study that's concluding this month and the options that are going to be presented from that I'd love to know a timeline of when we could start to see a timeline for something in particular for Horizon Village which has been devastated twice in the last 20 years by storms thank you all right um thanks council member I apologize I will have to get back to you on on both clove Lake and South Beach I just don't have those uh timelines at my fingertips um I know that as you say the clove Lake study is is winding down but I have not been briefed on what it's going to say yet so I I don't have any sneak peek to offer I'm sorry uh but happy to give you one in private sure um on the Southshore uh seaall that is something that uh has has occupied a fair bit of my attention personally I've spoken a congresswoman Malia takus about it personally um the uh um DEC commissioner basil seos uh and I have convened a number of meetings uh with the Army Corps with parks with national parks there are a number of agencies involved which is part of the problem right and I say that as an agency so we are sometimes part of the problem as well but the more agencies you have especially the more levels of government the more uh things drag on the good news is the first phase really is on the verge of issuing a contract um again I believe we've got somebody from the Army Court here so I won't make news for them you could ask them but uh I will simply assure you that getting that project underway has occupied a lot of my attention um a lot of commissioner seo's attention um I know Colonel young at the uh both Colonel young and Colonel Lloyd have been personally involved at the Army Corps so um we are on it what I will also say and I think I have learned a great deal uh from the problems that project has faced as we should apply to the Hat study right we need to think about the hats as being the Southshore of Staten Island project times 30 right um and so we have had issues with hazardous waste right as as you know there's a site there that's that's got radioactive waste that New York City has not actually got a track record of doing cleanups for so we are in a very thorny discussion with the federal and state governments about how to allocate responsibility for that we've had a very big issue that has caused caused significant delays and again I think this is a situation in which everybody's been working hard and everybody's been working in good faith but um because the Inland work is what's called a betterment the city is going to pay for it but also the city has to design it we have actually spent more than two years going back and forth with us sending them drawings and them sending them back and again I don't mean to say this as an attack or a criticism on the core I think they are working in good faith but everybody does things slightly differently so my agency has a really good track record of doing very big construction projects we don't do our designs in exactly the same way as the Army Corps does and so one of the things that was in as Elijah alluded to our recommendations and our input into the army corp's hat study and something frankly I've begun to talk to our Congressional Delegation about with respect to the upcoming water resources and defense authorization act which is happens every two years in Congress WTA um is actually about expanding the mission of hats so that not because we need the feds to pay more I think New York City should pay its fair share but because that division of design work is a killer and if we think about hats which is going to have not only multi climate hazards with Inland flooding that it has to address uh sunny day flooding that it's going to have to address from sea level rise but also things like recreation parks access access to fairies things like that the hats project like is going to be some of the most complex Waterfront work imaginable and if we wind up in a situation in which there are multiple agencies trying to design it together that is a recipe for delay that will add multiple decades to what is already a multiple decades program thank you let's catch up offline about that that's very important thank you chairs thank you thank you Council car uh I recognize councilman wrestler for questions thank you very much Cher jaro it's good to have you back and thank you to you and Cher Krishnan for your leadership on this hearing it it could not be more pressing and important and thank you to the administration officials for joining us today I'd like to just Begin by building off of chair krishnan's final comments about how we can anticipate these pegs to impact resiliency efforts uh across the city uh commissioner do you think you can realistically achieve the kind of Ambitions that you've set out with 15% pegs kind of uh over your head and if uh the other panelists would like to comment on how devastating these Draconian Cuts would be on your ability to effectively do your work we would welcome any any insights that you have to offer um well council member I'll I'll just start by by reiterating because our because D is funding and so the funding for storm water is water utility and we could save a a ton of money and it still can't be used for other other City purposes of course um D has not been subject to the peg so storm water resilience is not affected by the peg we are subject to the hiring frees and we are working with om in the hopes of getting exemptions from those uh from the hiring fre and there is this proc process around otps spending that has been frozen um and so we're trying to figure out how to unfreeze key categories there anything else you'd like to add about how you can navigate these extraordinary CS uh similar to uh what what parks also said we're we're in the process with om and and figuring this all out so um you know I just want to be clear climate change Remains the single greatest threat to the people of New York City we have to be deepening these Investments the prospect that across the board deep Cuts could impact our ability to make these necessary resiliency Investments and frankly much much more is and frankly much much more is and frankly much much more is um indefensible and I I I greatly hope that the mayor and B director uh will recognize that this is an area that must be spared from any potential Cuts uh just building on council member nurse's line of questioning similarly I think we're looking for Clarity on when we're going to see more comprehensive planning that can realistically provide protection for our communities and my recollection is that plan NYC requires we're now calling it plan NYC again is that the so not plan YC plan NYC oh I prefer plan YC if you don't mind but I also have a silent myps days it was plan YC I just was unsure where we were so under planyc we'll go with that um dp's required to release a storm water flooding adaption adaptation plan by 2024 and want to understand will this plan include Target improvements for specific areas that the city knows well flood and flood consistently what I certainly experience in Council District 33 which is Waterfront District is that it's the areas uh that flood when it rains a little that are absolutely decimated when it rains a lot and yet we don't see improvements we with all due respect commissioner I I Adore your staff I spend time and time again on the phone with them looking at sites they say they're going to make improvements they're never adequate and we continue to have enormous challenges and I don't know if it's the reticence to take on big lengthy capital projects that are obviously very costly but we're not seeing the interventions that are needed in the places on Dean Street and borm Hill on through and wab about and South Williamsburg New and mol and greenp point I mean these are the sites that everybody knows always flood Fourth Avenue in along Carol where shahan and I border they flood constantly and yet I don't see anything getting better how do we shift how do we do better is that going to be laid out in this plan next year how do how do I be a better advocate for my neighborhoods to actually see the Investments that we need uh well look council member I I we have been certainly for the last year and a half or nearly two years now we have been trying to shift gears at D to really focus on resilience as the driving force of a lot of our Capital thinking um for example uh we released the rainfall ready Maps last summer um that was new right that was the result of a lot of work some of it done at MJ uh under the previous administration um but that was new we are now in the process among other things of using those hotspots where we know there is flooding to guide our Capital prioritization right that is not not actually the way it had been done uh for Generations at D um so you know much like bringing kind of data driven rationality to how we do catch Bas and inspections um we're we're beginning the process of bringing that kind of risk or or impact uh prioritization to how we think about Capital Investments to address flooding among the big things that is just about ready or we're beginning to use it now but has been a major investment over the last year or two um is building what we call an all pipes model so we now have I won't call it a digital twin it's not quite that fancy but really for the first time we now have a model of how all of the sewers interconnect um that's really important because what we know first of all it's all interconnected and so among the things that we are now just at the at the early stages of being able to do is understand well if there's flooding down here the fastest most cost away cost effective way to address it might not be there it might be Upstream because all the water up here is Flowing down here it may also be that if there's flooding up here the real problem is a bottleneck down here we now have the ability to really understand that and one of the things that I think we are coming to terms with as an agency is the fact that until until the weather started changing a couple of years ago we didn't need to worry about this that much we just didn't have to understand it right and now we do um and so we are building the infrastructure so that we can do that kind of rational planning yes we are working towards a comprehensive strategy I do not I am not yet able to tell you how detailed or specific that will be what I can tell you is that we are working on it with a large team with a lot of interbau and in fact inter agency work going on it is something that is one of my top priorities it is not coincidental that the mayor asked me to be Chief climate officer and commissioner at DP um at the same time it's precisely to make sure that we are fully integrating DP into this and of course we will be bringing uh we will be standing up this Bureau of coastal resilience in part because one of the things we've realized and not realized but one of the things we are acting on um is the reality that the first place that uh tidal flows go is down the drain and one of the things which we certainly saw on the 29th one of the issues that caused even more flooding than that massive rainstorm the second most intense rainstorm in the city's recorded history brought us was the fact that the hour of most intense rain from 8: a.m. to 9:00 a.m. unfortunately took place at high tide and so we had a number of parts of the city where our outflow which otherwise would have drained water out of the city into the harbor actually were backed up because the tide had risen so high that they were covered over so among the things we have to work on is and I'm sorry chair I'm but I I want to give a complete answer I sore to give given a time I thought that chair Krishna promised me double the time today I must have misunderstood but uh but among the things that we are we are working on is how to accelerate the tide Gates so that we can prevent flooding from occurring because water is backing up which is something for example that happens regularly unfortunately in the rockco look and it's this is interconnected to to some of the proposals that were included in the Hat study it's I will just say I thought I appreciated the the Army Court engaging with us as a communities across the city in a quite open and thoughtful way I could never understand what the city's position was throughout this process and so I struggled to understand what the city was advocating for my community was organized we were pushing we were very concerned about 15t walls that would um you know create a bathtub effect and cut our communities off from our waterfronts but I'd really like to better understand maybe with new leadership we can have those conversations uh in the mayor's office to to have Clarity on what you're all advocating for and I'll just say in closing because I've gone over time in part because you gave such a thoughtful um and lengthy response uh I appreciate a data- driven approach to identifying the where we need to make the Capital Improvements to improve our sewer infrastructure I don't have the data but I know the lived experience of my neighbors and I can tell you the places in my community that are hit time and again and again and we will provide that list once again to D and be the squeakiest wheel that I know how to be but we desperately want to see attention and intervention in these sites that are problematic sites so look for an email from me very shortly but you know hope we can work together to make some improvements in our Waterfront District thank you thanks so much councilman westler a lot of leeway there on that one um council member Holden thank you chairs and I I want a link and wrestler time also I get man once you start slippery slope I'm on both committees so we should do we should get extra time thank you thank you Comm thank you chairs and thank you commissioner um two questions regarding storm water runoff um one problem uh I have a lot of utility work in my district many blocks and I brought this up to to De uh DP many times especially National Grid they're putting replacing gas lines on the sidewalk when they restore the sidewalk they pave the whole thing including the strip that's not the property owners space that's the city space used to be a grass strip now we have concrete which is counterproductive if we're doing you know the the BIOS swes or the rain Gardens and then we're Paving over blocks and blocks in districts around queens and throughout the city that's one where I do have pending legislation that would actually Define that space that you can't pave over it it hasn't been drafted yet I'm waiting several weeks or months and but I think that could be part of your plan to to mitigate some of the because obviously the the storm water runoff that we're experiencing experiencing now in my district it goes into the New Town Creek and we know what that's like the New Town Creek is is another story but um the second thing the The Yards text amendment of 2008 that this Council passed it's really not being enforced properly by do I see every every construction project in my district I almost every one of them I have to address meaning somebody's not paying attention at dob if they're permitting this you know they're allowing it I send inspectors down there from do and most of the time they come back to they didn't find anything wrong and I know this so I have to send another inspector and depending on which do inspector I they send I get lucky sometimes most of the time I'm spinning my wheels that means and this is by the the way there's been articles about this for since 2008 about how the do is not really enforcing it so we need to pull all this together my question would be number one on the on the The Yards text amendment can D actually help out and kind of guide do OB because I don't know again if they if they're really educating their inspectors properly and I'll speak to the commissioner of do also but questions one would be would you get involved in that in helping because that I'm telling you almost every project that I'm seeing in my district that they're Paving over because they want to park more cars and it is and they're putting in everywhere they're putting in their cars in front of their their Stoops in their doorways which I'm trying to get you know do to enforce that that's almost impossible and I'm actually reaching out to the fire department because that seems to be you're blocking egress you know so all these so all these questions we need help from your a or somebody's help on this um thank you uh council member um look I will uh so the the issue of the text Amendment enforcement is something that that I I certainly know is a challenge um I I think it is worth having a conversation that I would be happy to engage with commissioner adto about in terms of how we think perhaps differently about enforcement I don't know whether that would require a legislative change or or an inter agency agreement we would need to think about how we resource something like that because we you know I think one of the things frankly that tends to happen is that we assign tasks based on who has resources or who has expertise as opposed to oppos to which agency is really focused on ensuring that a bad thing doesn't happen um and uh and there may need to be some realignment there but but just on on dealing with inspectors that don't know the law that's one thing it's another thing because I'm always talking to homeowners and they're complaining they're getting flooded they're their sewers are backing up and I said well look at your neighbors I I said part of the problem is if you look at your even your uh property you've paved over 90 or 100% of your your your yard and that's causing it well no it's I said it's overdevelopment but it's we're concreting everything we're we're we're cementing grass but when the city actually does it when the city participates in that like I mentioned about the grass strip it may not seem like a lot but when you look at entire blocks of my district and I photographed this and I did give it to D I said let's do something about this let's stop doing this let's put more grass and with again if it takes legislation I'll do it uh however it shouldn't really it because it's not really the property owner's space there they most of the properties it ends at the sidewalk and then you have that strip of it could be four feet it could be more in certain areas so if we can coordinate that and kind of quickly because that's they're replacing you know Miles and Miles every day and and it's National Grid and and ConEd that that are doing it and each time I talk to them they say you know we we don't know anything about that we we'll we'll PVE and they're Paving it and it's not their property it's not it's the city's property but we can control that thanks and I just want to jump in for a second I just want to give uh Bob a little latitude because this an important question and I I think we all see it and so I'm going to give him a little latitude ude here and he also sits next to me at the council so you know they yeah I could I could harass you sometimes on that but no this is this is important so R take as long as you want to um give an answer to that um well look on on this one I uh I would I I will confess it's not something that I have an answer to uh off the top of my head but I'm happy to to work with you it's something that I've I've heard in the past how we enforce construction rules across the city frankly we mention it in plan YC is something that we've got to have happen it's something that is part of uh the um city of yes for carbon neutrality that's I believe coming before the city council very soon um but on the specific issue of what conad and and National Grid might be doing on the sidewalks I I will follow up with you thank you thank you commission thank you Council M Holden uh I recognize council member Vasquez hi and thank you commissioner um thank you for your work so listening to my colleagues and they questioning uh I can't help but ask you a lot of these would be facilitated better with buau Commissioners and so why hasn't uh DP hired any buau Commissioners yet um well thank thank you council member uh we um so the the position of burough Commissioners was actually legislated by the city council I believe uh two years ago so we have been in the process of getting ready and hiring and recruiting and and with the hiring frees we're a little bit stuck right now but um I'm hoping to work through that uh because I I agree with you among the themes that we've heard here is better communication and that is something that um you know I have a my Deputy Commissioner for public affairs and Communications who's been doing a great job but is trying to build her team um and and we could use those extra resources do we expect that to be done within this calendar year or again there's the hiring frees right now and and om is working through the exception requests and and uh I don't have any I don't have a timeline I can give you right now perfect thank you for that um you had mentioned earlier the D risk assessment um is there a way that we as council members can get what that looks like in our district I I know certain parts of my district every single time that there is flooding and and you've seen it not just the flooding but also the sink holes that happen afterwards specifically in my district because of the construction in the 20s um is there a way to get that information to us well one of the things that I you know again in with a with a more structured approach to outreach that I would love to be able to do is ensure that and council member wrestler's question kind of Incorporated this ensure that our uh rainfall ready map that we're really relying on incorporates all of the kind of lived experience out there you know I've been very pleased when I go out um you know as I as I did with you and in your district and with others and across the city and and we talk to constituents who have experienced flooding our map is usually accurate but it's not 100% necessarily and and before we make decisions on it we'd like to incorporate all of that I would like to do that in a systematic way we haven't started that yet um and I think frankly it's it's um kind of just how we sequence the work uh I I really cannot stress enough how daunting the challenge of the city's uh storm water management is it is a breathtakingly complex uh system and so right now we've prioritized looking at a a number of known a very finite number I will point out um number of locations that we think typify the kind of problems that we see much more broadly around the city to identify how some of the solutions might work so that we can figure out by extrapolation what would a Citywide response actually involve that's that's really step one um which is in part why I you know frankly had to hedge a little bit with council member wrestler's question because I don't know how prec precise next year's plan is going to be but it is certainly going to be a step in the right direction I appreciate that because I I have so many local groups who are willing and able to come and help with the cleaning at least of the catch Bas on the surface area and so if we can just find those areas that we need to Target especially on days that we know are going to be significant uh with with significant uh rainfall then we want to be ready as well and if we can just Target those areas as a community we can actually spare a lot of the work that you guys uh would have to do as well so that way like we got to work together and this is a pathway to that um you had mentioned flood alarms as a recommendation to uh council member Brooks Powers is there an opportunity there to launch a city-wide program to cover for uh families uh that uh have a s a significant low-income bracket to where we're actually like saving their lives do you see a benefit for this um well so so the good news is these are not very expensive devices right I I don't have a number off the top of my head but we're not talking about a $50 or $100 um item uh and DP has some that we are very happy to give away we haven't done that in a systematic Citywide way but it is something worth exploring all right thank you that's all my questions thanks so much council member and now we have council member naris thank you chair good afternoon everyone and by the way you're one of the important agency in my life because I represent the 46 District um it been a problem for us even worse ever since Sandy um every little rain all the calls that I'm getting and usually I have to be on the street Riding the Storm to go around and visit folks in my district which is Garrison Beach uh Bergen Beach canari uh meal Basin area so you know where I'm talking about right so um in my district it's every day that it when I see Ren I have to cross my little finger so what can we do what's in plan to um to ease our pain in in this District because we talking about sewage backup I witness feces coming to people's home so I'm wondering where we at and before we get to that answer we have infrastructure money out there from the federal level how many proposal that you you have forth in front of the federal to make sure that we get our fair share in the city of New York um I will ask uh Elijah to give you some of the numbers around Federal let me take uh a couple of as a as I said earlier one of our challenges with Federal money is um and frankly I've had this conversation with a number of members of our our Congressional Delegation is that they believe that well if New York City is going to get EX or New York State's going to get develon um that we've been you know that we get by formula what BBG resilience money is going to be invested um and we have been very successful very successful very successful very successful very successful very successful very successful very successful facilities um that so that's that's been very successful uh I'll see if we can get back to you either right now or or later with a number on or later with a number on or later with a number on or later with a number on government has a competitive program that they are has a competitive program that they are has a competitive program that they are huge amount of water infrastructure money federal government that the state has determined New York City should not have access that the state has determined New York City should not have access that the state has determined New York City should not have access by by infrastructure uh which I think is unfair we have unfair we have unfair we have unfair we have maximize Federal money um and I think where um and I think where um and I think where um where the deck is not stacked against um you asked about um you asked about I want to know are there any I want to know are there any uh to know where these things are happening these things are happening um these things are happening um these things are happening um done a pretty good job over the last decade of reducing we have fewer than half as many sewer backups uh as we did as many sewer backups uh as we did as many sewer backups uh as we did it's still too many um one it's still too many um one of is that actually more than half of the sewer backups that are not due to what's going on are not due to what's going on so when a sewer backup is reported costs a significant amount of time in money costs a significant amount of time in money causing their own sewer backups because what we is a lot of situations in which uh the rain got Earth it line and in a major rainstorm like we and in a major rainstorm like we that kind of pressure behind the sewer that kind of pressure behind the sewer is actually liable to cause is actually liable to cause to the home and I and I think to the home and I and I think to the home and I and I think backup complaints where we send a truck there is no evidence backed up so there should not have been a sewer backup backed up so there should not have been a sewer backup because you've got a rain gutter because you've got a rain gutter parts of your District uh or put a rain barrel underneath it and then you've got the and then you've got the benefit of and then you've got the benefit of as the rain barrel is designed to do and chair I know I'm pushing it but I heard about 160,000 catch Bas and throughout the city and you have about 2,000 that's kind of like uh high priority area so do you have a list of where the high priority areas are and in the catch Basin and in the catch Basin and in the catch basin water flooding all because every if you want to checking all because every if you want to check calling me left and right I I I cannot sleep when is um heavy rain so when it's a stor forget it so I need your help commissioner I don't want to squeeze because I went out of my time but I need your help in my but I need your help in my but I need your help in my agencies like EPA Noah FEMA through the brick which were specifically um targeting that work an application to get more resources to get more resources I appreciate you and I'm hoping um so we can do some seminars together something got to be done because those people actually are in needs because like I said last last week again I had to go all over Garrison Beach and seeing people's houses under the flood that's unfair and having the backups from the sewage system that's from the sewage system that's from the sewage system that's uh the speed of projects and and um I guess the way I see it the way I see it the way I see it our challenge is not not wanting to do the right thing it is not even a lack of capital because once we have projects identified I have a 30 1 billion 10-year Capital plan at D capital is not really the main constraint um if we choose to prioritize I mean I don't I don't think we've had a lot of instances where or blue belt or cloudburst projects have been delayed I you know they in the popular imagination there's a lot that we blame uh environmental impact statements on uh for which is not necessarily the issue here um it I'm I'm just pointing out I'm I'm just pointing out where's the 22nd project it's how do we push all of them through the pipeline as quickly as possible um some of that is just about having really good management and I could not be more proud of the work that my agency has done in terms of managing its procure in terms of managing its procure in terms of managing its procure good management internally right um but there are ways that city does that the city does for city does that the city does for city does that the city does for car it is and and obviously you know obviously you know we have to obviously you know we have to m we can we can certainly brainstorm about this at uh at uh over our next at uh over our next forward since and and you know the first just reiterate I think it what um really was a building off uh almost 10 years of work after that that was inspired and included and identified in the wetlands um strategy that we then used as the foundation for the further road map focusing on New York City par marks wetlands in the the wetlands management framework so I will just um just wanted to highlight that that many of the uh recommendations and uh including addressing the need to develop better Wetlands map was were something that we continued to work on through getting US EPA funding uh in numerous uh in numerous uh in numerous like I said I got I got I got I got Robert texting that's fine absolutely okay I I certainly appreciate that and um to close out this panel my team co-chair my team co-chair my team co-chair my team co-chair much uh chair janiro actually before I go with my my closing questions we have I've been joined by Council M Gutierrez um who I think has a guz um who I think has a construction of the actual development which is um in any of of the buildings and I really think it's I don't know what the exact terminology is but like kind of where it is there around bu can it floods but the actual buildings flood and so every single Lobby even if it's if it's not even a cloudburst will flood and so I'm curious what what is the communication with Nicha like what what is something that I can do in this instance I can do in this instance I can do in this instance I can do in this instance I'm just curious what your communication with Nicha looks like overall and some of these like what your communication with Nicha looks like overall and some of these like the some of the things that I can be elevating cuz it is it is a problem and some of these I mean I I represent Williamsburg houses it's the oldest development in Brooklyn oldest development in Brooklyn oldest development in Brooklyn oldest development in Brooklyn about resilience um as with everything at Nicha the resources are always far short of the actual need but I think uh overall if you look at the portfolio overall if you look at the portfolio overall if you look at the portfolio overall if you look at the portfolio 11 years ago at Hurricane Sandy they've made a lot of progress they've made a lot of progress they've made a lot of progress they've made a lot of progress was buildings that didn't have electricity didn't have away the the top priority that I think niga has wisely embraced is to make sure that when the water goes away there aren't the lingering problems um that is not to say they have solved everything and I don't think anybody at Nicha would say that they have solved everything uh I do think there sustainability and resilience team is really and resilience team is really and resilience team is really and resilience team is really barin houses I I don't carry the details in my head I'd be very happy personally to to follow up with you um and perhaps even talk to Nicha jointly thank you you are very confident in Nicha and yes we will we will follow up thank you so much that's all thank member Sandy nurse who had to leave um for Parks um assistant commissioner Council nur's first question is is Parks considering allowing experienced large community compost organizations like big reuse to compost on appropriate park lands sites well we do already have composting on Parkland sites at um at certain locations um I don't know if perhaps Sarah neelon my colleague might want to address that in any in any more detail can you please raise your right hand once I wrestle this chair there we go do you swear or firm to tell the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth today yes um yes um yes um yes um is about whether Parks cont contemplating you adding additional compost facilities is that correct organizations especially like big reuse to compost on the on the appropriate Park sites right right so appreciate the question this is definitely something that the agency has been talking about with um sanitation as far as you know managing their new um compost need with the influx of of with their work so I think it's something that the agencies are you know addressing together um we do know that there's such a huge demand of parks facilities facilities and there's other city land that might be appropriate like a more fullsome answer for you although I have a feeling that but I don't have the specifics for you sure I'll let Council M nurse know too and would be helpful to have more information on that point as well absolutely can do that thanks so much that concludes the questions from our uh panel anything else all right well thank you so much to all I will thank you so much to all I will thank you so much to all we very much appreciate it all right um what we'll do is we'll we'll call up about three um members of the public at a time for for Testimony um if you can we'd urge you to keep your testimony to uh two minutes and we'll start the clock as soon as you start speaking so our first three uh panelists are jimmyo ly Kelly and Robert kamacho shice palmo Lyn Kelly and robertt kamacho and and uh

be testifying on behalf of Lyn Kelly who had to leave early um thank you chairs chrisan and Janeiro and committee members for having this important hearing which is very timely considering the Citywide flooding on September 29th I'm Lyn Kelly and I'm the executive director of the New York restoration project and co-chair of NYC parks and open space Partners Coalition today I'm testifying on behalf of the NYC parks and Open Spaces a coalition representing over 50 organizations that share ideas to address common challenges amplify advocacy efforts and offer technical assistance and guidance and service of an equitable guidance and service of an equitable answer to a complex situation in which human beings those cuts of 15% they could expect to see a devastating impact on our Park system which is still recovering from Cuts made during Co 19 and has fewer workers than it did before the pandemic this austerity plan only furthers societal division during a time when we should be building community and ensuring the availability of critical services to new and current critical services to new and current critical services to new and current critical services to new and current critical services to new and current tree canopy coverage achieving these goals are vital not only to make our city more sustainable and Equitable but also to combat the impacts of climate change the time to implement these measures has never been more critical these measures has never been more critical these measures has never been more critical city parks Foundation Al New York League of conservation voters and Emily Walker natural areas Conservancy thank you uh hi everyone uh my name is Alia Sumo and I'm the deputy director for New York City policy at the New York League of conservation voters thank you chairs Krishan and Janeiro and members of the par and members of the part budget to Parks nylcv is also a member of to each other parks and green spaces make up 14% parks and green spaces make up 14% Urban Forest canopy in the city and roughly half of the land managed by NYC parks is directly on the water yet New York City Parks receive less than 1% of the city's budget we cannot maintain our Park system increase our tree canopy or improve our Waterfront resiliency if we cut our Park budget all three coalitions show that over 600 organizations in the city support parks open space tree canopy Waterfront environmental justice and air quality emergencies and the heavy rainfall on the 20 Conservancy thank you to chairs Krishna and janaro and members and in particular our natural areas play a tremendous role in protecting and fostering a more resilient City when it comes to our our natural areas the data it comes to our natural areas the data it comes to our natural areas the data it comes to our natural areas the data nearly 70% of the carbon stored and 83% of the carbon sequestered by trees across the city there are almost 10 degrees cool there are almost 10 degrees cool hospital bills from pollution induced illness annually they provide $2.2 billion in recreational value $1.1 billion do in public health value and they soak up as much storm water as $580 Million worth of new green storm water infrastructure despite these benefits the stresses on our natural areas are tremendous and without appropriate public investments in their care we stand to lose these assets entirely we are deeply alarmed by the Citywide budget cuts that were announced in September the mandated 5% budget cuts now in effect will have a catastrophic impact on the ability of NYC parks to implement much of its work including critical care for our natural for including critical care for our natural for will no longer be implemented I also want to express I also want to express our concern I also want to express our concern I also want to express our concern one of nac's Trail maintainers is with us today in City Hall and I just want to note that her work exemplifies the kind of care that we should be performing for nyc's land and we're taking away crucial funding to help support that work funding to help support that work but also believe that the urgency of this moment requires us to speak out about further constraints on the budget for Parks parks in natural areas benefit the lives of every New Yorker from longtime residents to our most recent arrivals we understand that moments of Crisis demand hard choices from our electeds but we also believe that these choices should not come at the expense of shared resources that make our C of shared resources that make our city in climate crisis we call on our elected officials from every level of nyc's government to work together to restore their proposed budget cuts and prevent additional cuts to services that make our city stronger thank you that encourages New Yorkers to use and care for their neighborhood parks and open care for their neighborhood parks and open care for their neighborhood parks and open care for their neighborhood parks and open care for their neighborhood parks and open I encouraging the community to conduct water testing we Reve connecting children

um good afternoon my name is wen't you just here weren't you just here it's my stunt I have a twin brother so yeah you couldn't change a shirt put a hat on or yeah I should have got the fake yeah I should have got the fake York restoration project thank you for the opportunity to provide testimony again this afternoon chair Krishna and chair Janeiro and yrp is a proud member of the play fair Coalition a coalition of 400 organizations across the city advocating for the city's Park system and why system and wi system and why system and why our partners we are here today in opposition to administration's proposed austerity cuts of 15% which would devastate the already chronically underfunded and understaffed New York City Parks climate change is at our doorstep only 12 12 days ago NYC was ravaged by flooding underscored the need for the city to invest in proven Solutions and green infrastructure such as parks waterfronts and open space Parks can reduce water runoff by 90% And filter out as much as 95% and filter out as much as 95 flooding and erosion nrp's work with the living Shoreline at Sherman Creek Park in Northern Manhattan is creating wetlands and oyster habitats which are protecting shorelines and uh providing natural defense enses against flooding for the community nrp's investment in his critical green infrastructure also allows for public Waterfront access while improving the ecological health of the park something too rare in New York City especially in underserved communities these new wetlands are storing carbon and removing nitrogen from Waters at surprisingly High rates this mean Parks have been operating with an austerity budget for 50 years an underfunded parks department means less maintenance workers and pep officers who keep the parks clean and safe nyc's forested areas soak up as much as storm water as 580 million worth of new green storm water infrastructure New York City's natural areas are 4 to 6 degrees cooler than the average temperature during extreme heat events extreme hit heat events extreme hit heat events extreme hit heat events here go yep okay there we go okay there we go okay there we go hi uh thank you so much for holding this hearing my name is Annie caror I'm the climate Justice campaign manager representing we act for environmental justice we act for environmental justice green spaces and access to the Waterfront are not equably distributed across the city access to Green spaces is on average much lower in environmental justice neighborhoods that are already plagued by adverse health problems and high levels of pollution low-income communities have 21% less park space 21% less park space 21% less park space cuts of 5 to 15% will further decrease perent will further decrease percent will further decrease percent will further decrease workers that live in environmental justice communities who are disproportionately black and Latin neck and who need green space in park space the most I have an anecdotal I have an anecdotal they told us that East Harlem is a hostile environment for baby trees\""
